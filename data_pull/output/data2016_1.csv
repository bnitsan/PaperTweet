In a non-Abelian gauge theory, these are necessarily composite operators. We investigate the spectrum of these operators in the two-Higgs-doublet model. For this purpose, we are working along the lines of the Fr\""ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi mechanism to relate the physical spectrum to the spectrum of the elementary particles. We also investigate the consequences of spontaneous breaking of the global (custodial) symmetry group. Finally, we briefly comment on how to test the results using lattice methods.

A Bayesian information capacity criterion is defined for the selection of designs that are robust to the form of the linear predictor. For binomial data and logistic regression, the effectiveness of these designs for screening is assessed through simulation studies using all-subsets regression and model selection via maximum penalised likelihood and a generalised information criterion. For Poisson data and log-linear regression, similar assessments are made using maximum likelihood and the Akaike information criterion for minimally-supported designs that are constructed analytically. The results show that effective screening, that is, high power with moderate type I error rate and false discovery rate, can be achieved through suitable choices for the number of design support points and experiment size. Logistic regression is shown to present a more challenging problem than log-linear regression. Some areas for future work are also indicated.

Examining holographic gravity, we argue that its underlying assumptions can be justified in part using recent results on the form of the modular energy in quantum field theory.

Estimates of R_0 were then used to project the likelihood for large outbreak sizes, e.g., exceeding hundreds of thousands of cases. Yet fitting deterministic models can lead to over-confidence in the confidence intervals of the fitted R_0, and, in turn, the type and scope of necessary interventions. In this manuscript we propose a hybrid stochastic-deterministic method to estimate R_0 and associated confidence intervals (CIs). The core idea is that stochastic realizations of an underlying deterministic model can be used to evaluate the compatibility of candidate values of R_0 with observed epidemic curves. The compatibility is based on comparing the distribution of expected epidemic growth rates with the observed epidemic growth rate given ""process noise"", i.e., arising due to stochastic transmission, recovery and death events. By applying our method to reported EVD case counts from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, we show that prior estimates of R_0 based on deterministic fits appear to be more confident than analysis of stochastic trajectories suggests should be possible. Moving forward, we recommend including a hybrid stochastic-deterministic fitting procedure when quantifying the full R_0 CI at the onset of an epidemic due to multiple sources of noise.

The stream's proximity to the Galactic center suggests that the bar must have a significant influence on its dynamical history: The triaxiality and time-dependence of the bar may generate chaotic orbits in the vicinity of the stream that can greatly affect its morphology. We explore this hypothesis with models of stream formation along orbits consistent with Ophiuchus' properties in a Milky Way potential model that includes a rotating bar. We find that in all choices for the rotation parameters of the bar, orbits fit to the stream are strongly chaotic. Mock streams generated along these orbits qualitatively match the observed properties of the stream: because of chaos, stars stripped early generally form low-density, high-dispersion ""fans"" leaving only the most recently disrupted material detectable as a strong over-density. Our models predict that there should be more low-surface-brightness tidal debris than detected so far, likely with a complex phase-space morphology. The existence of or lack of these features around the Ophiuchus stream would provide an interesting constraint on the properties of the Milky Way bar and would help distinguish between formation scenarios for the stream. This is the first time that chaos has been used to explain the properties of a stellar stream and is the first demonstration of the dynamical importance of chaos in the Galactic halo. The existence of long, thin streams around the Milky Way---presumably formed along non- or weakly-chaotic orbits---may represent only a subset of the total population of disrupted satellites.

We find that the residual spectrum of Cluster A is free of instrumental artifacts while that of Cluster B contains significant features with amplitudes ~1%; the most prominent is in the energy range 30-50 keV, which coincides with the iodine K edge. Starting with the residual spectrum for Cluster B, via an iterative procedure we created the calibration tool hexBcorr for correcting any Cluster B spectrum of interest. We demonstrate the efficacy of the tool by applying it to Cluster B spectra of two bright black holes, which contain several million counts apiece. For these spectra, application of the tool significantly improves the goodness of fit, while affecting only slightly the broadband fit parameters.

Their definition turns on whether or not larger cities and regions are more efficient and more productive than smaller ones. We complement existing discussion on agglomeration economies and the urban wage premium here by providing a sensitivity analysis of estimated coefficients to different delineations of urban agglomeration as well as to different definitions of the economic measure that summarises the urban premium. This quantity can consist of total wages measured at the place of work, or of income registered at the place of residence. The chosen option influences the scaling behaviour of city size as well as the spatial distribution of the phenomenon at the city level. Spatial discrepancies between the distribution of jobs and the distribution of households at different economic levels makes city definitions crucial to the estimation of economic relations which vary with city size. We argue this point by regressing measures of income and wage over about five thousands different definitions of cities in France, based on our algorithmic aggregation of administrative spatial units at regular cutoffs which reflect density, population thresholds and commuting flows. We also go beyond aggregated observations of wages and income by searching for evidence of larger inequalities and economic segregation in the largest cities. This paper therefore considers the spatial and economic complexity of cities with respect to discussion about how we measure agglomeration economies. It provides a basis for reflection on alternative ways to model the processes which lead to observed variations, and this can provide insights for more comprehensive regional planning.

The short-period spin and strong magnetic field are able to accelerate particles up to the appropriate energies, and the composition of material on and around the magnetar may naturally explain recent inferences of heavy elements in UHECRs. We explore whether the small amount of natal debris surrounding these magnetars allows the UHECRs to easily escape. We also investigate the impact on the UHECRs of the unique environment around the magnetar, which consists of a bubble of relativistic particles and magnetic field within the debris. Rates and energetics of UHECRs are consistent with such an origin even though the rates of events that produce rapidly-spinning magnetars remain very uncertain. The low ejecta mass also helps limit the high-energy neutrino background associated with this scenario to be below current IceCube constraints over most of the magnetar parameter space.

The kinematics properties of the extraplanar gas, including velocity asymmetries and increased dispersion, are used to differentiate galaxies hosting large-scale galactic winds from those dominated by the extended diffuse ionized gas. We find rather that a spectrum of diffuse gas-dominated to wind dominated galaxies exist. The wind-dominated galaxies span a wide range of star formation rates ($-1 \lesssim \log({\rm SFR/M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}) \lesssim 0.5$) across the whole stellar mass range of the sample ($8.5 \lesssim \log({\rm M_{*}/M_{\odot}}) \lesssim 11$). The wind galaxies also span a wide range in SFR surface densities ($10^{-3} \textrm{--} 10^{-1.5}\rm~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$) that is much lower than the canonical threshold of $\rm0.1~M_{\odot} ~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$. The wind galaxies on average have higher SFR surface densities and higher $\rm H\delta_A$ values than those without strong wind signatures. The enhanced $\rm H\delta_A$ indicates that bursts of star formation in the recent past are necessary for driving large-scale galactic winds. We demonstrate with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data that galaxies with high SFR surface density have experienced bursts of star formation in the recent past. Our results imply that the galactic winds revealed in our study are indeed driven by bursts of star formation, and thus probing star formation in the time domain is crucial for finding and understanding galactic winds.

We present the application of marginalisation based on Gibson (2014) to analyse exoplanet transit lightcurves obtained from HST WFC3, to better determine important transit parameters such as R$_p$/R$_*$, important for accurate detections of H$_2$O. We approximate the evidence, often referred to as the marginal likelihood, for a grid of systematic models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). We then calculate the evidence-based weight assigned to each systematic model and use the information from all tested models to calculate the final marginalised transit parameters for both the band-integrated, and spectroscopic lightcurves to construct the transmission spectrum. We find that a majority of the highest weight models contain a correction for a linear trend in time, as well as corrections related to HST orbital phase. We additionally test the dependence on the shift in spectral wavelength position over the course of the observations and find that spectroscopic wavelength shifts $\delta_\lambda(\lambda)$, best describe the associated systematic in the spectroscopic lightcurves for most targets, while fast scan rate observations of bright targets require an additional level of processing to produce a robust transmission spectrum. The use of marginalisation allows for transparent interpretation and understanding of the instrument and the impact of each systematic evaluated statistically for each dataset, expanding the ability to make true and comprehensive comparisons between exoplanet atmospheres.

Here we focus on Synthetic Likelihood (SL), a procedure that reduces the observed and simulated data to a set of summary statistics, and quantifies the discrepancy between them through a synthetic likelihood function. SL requires little tuning, but it relies on the approximate normality of the summary statistics. We relax this assumption by proposing a novel, more flexible, density estimator: the Extended Empirical Saddlepoint approximation. In addition to proving the consistency of SL, under either the new or the Gaussian density estimator, we illustrate the method using two examples. One of these is a complex individual-based forest model for which SL offers one of the few practical possibilities for statistical inference. The examples show that the new density estimator is able to capture large departures from normality, while being scalable to high dimensions, and this in turn leads to more accurate parameter estimates, relative to the Gaussian alternative. The new density estimator is implemented by the esaddle R package, which can be found on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). ","An Extended Empirical Saddlepoint Approximation for Intractable

We followed up these candidates with high-signal-to-noise optical spectroscopy from the 4.2-m William Herschel Telescope. Using ground-based, time-series photometry, we put our sample of new spectroscopically characterized white dwarfs in the context of the empirical ZZ Ceti instability strip. Prior to our search, only two pulsating white dwarfs had been observed by Kepler. Ultimately, four of our new ZZ Cetis were observed from space.

Here, we incorporate the influence of short- and long-range correlations in the pairing gaps. Short-range correlations are treated including the appropriate fragmentation of single-particle states, and substantially suppress the gaps. Long-range correlations dress the pairing interaction via density and spin modes, and provide a relatively small correction. We use different interactions, some with three-body forces, as a starting point to control for any systematic effects. Results are relevant for neutron-star cooling scenarios, in particular in view of the recent observational data on Cassiopeia A.

Our new paper: <LINK>  @EdBaskerville'],http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00716,"Infectious diseases are notorious for their complex dynamics, which make it difficult to fit models to test hypotheses. Methods based on state-space reconstruction have been proposed to infer causal interactions in noisy, nonlinear dynamical systems. These ""model-free"" methods are collectively known as convergent cross-mapping (CCM). Although CCM has theoretical support, natural systems routinely violate its assumptions. To identify the practical limits of causal inference under CCM, we simulated the dynamics of two pathogen strains with varying interaction strengths. The original method of CCM is extremely sensitive to periodic fluctuations, inferring interactions between independent strains that oscillate with similar frequencies. This sensitivity vanishes with alternative criteria for inferring causality. However, CCM remains sensitive to high levels of process noise and changes to the deterministic attractor. This sensitivity is problematic because it remains challenging to gauge noise and dynamical changes in natural systems, including the quality of reconstructed attractors that underlie cross-mapping. We illustrate these challenges by analyzing time series of reportable childhood infections in New York City and Chicago during the pre-vaccine era. We comment on the statistical and conceptual challenges that currently limit the use of state-space reconstruction in causal inference.
