When the pathogen of interest is transmissible between study subjects, interference may occur: individual infection outcomes may depend on treatments received by others. Epidemiologists have defined the primary causal effect of interest -- called the ""susceptibility effect"" -- as a contrast in infection risk under treatment versus no treatment, while holding exposure to infectiousness constant. A related quantity -- the ""direct effect"" -- is defined as an unconditional contrast between the infection risk under treatment versus no treatment. The purpose of this paper is to show that under a widely recommended randomization design, the direct effect may fail to recover the sign of the true susceptibility effect of the intervention in a randomized trial when outcomes are contagious. The analytical approach uses structural features of infectious disease transmission to define the susceptibility effect. A new probabilistic coupling argument reveals stochastic dominance relations between potential infection outcomes under different treatment allocations. The results suggest that estimating the direct effect under randomization may provide misleading inferences about the effect of an intervention -- such as a vaccine -- when outcomes are contagious.

Changing the slope angle $\alpha$ modifies these mixing parameters, and the flow approaches a maximum Richardson number $Ri_\textrm{max}\approx 0.15$ as $\alpha \rightarrow 0$ at which the entrainment coefficient $E \rightarrow 0$. The turbulent Prandtl number remains $O(1)$ for all slope angles, demonstrating that $E\rightarrow 0$ is not caused by a switch-off of the turbulent buoyancy flux as conjectured by Ellison (1957). Instead, $E \rightarrow 0$ occurs as the result of the turbulence intensity going to zero as $\alpha\rightarrow 0$, due to the flow requiring larger and larger shear to maintain the same level of turbulence. We develop an approximate model valid for small $\alpha$ which is able to predict accurately $Ri_f$, $Ri_g$ and $\Gamma$ as a function of $\alpha$ and their maximum attainable values. The model predicts an entrainment law of the form $E=0.31(Ri_\textrm{max}-Ri)$, which is in good agreement with the simulation data. The simulations and model presented here contribute to a growing body of evidence that an approach to a marginally or critically stable, relatively weakly stratified equilibrium for stratified shear flows may well be a generic property of turbulent stratified flows.

We explore the AGN fraction as a function of stellar mass, and find that the fraction of variable AGN increases with stellar mass, even after taking into account the fact that lower mass systems are fainter. There are several possible explanations for an observed decline in the fraction of variable AGN with decreasing stellar mass, including a drop in the supermassive black hole occupation fraction, a decrease in the ratio of black hole mass to galaxy stellar mass, or a change in the variability properties of lower-mass AGNs.

We tackle this task by introducing a notion of temporal core decomposition where each core is associated with its span: we call such cores span-cores. As the total number of time intervals is quadratic in the size of the temporal domain $T$ under analysis, the total number of span-cores is quadratic in $|T|$ as well. Our first contribution is an algorithm that, by exploiting containment properties among span-cores, computes all the span-cores efficiently. Then, we focus on the problem of finding only the maximal span-cores, i.e., span-cores that are not dominated by any other span-core by both the coreness property and the span. We devise a very efficient algorithm that exploits theoretical findings on the maximality condition to directly compute the maximal ones without computing all span-cores. Experimentation on several real-world temporal networks confirms the efficiency and scalability of our methods.

In this paper, we adapt models of strategic manipulation to capture dynamics that may arise in a setting of social inequality wherein candidate groups face different costs to manipulation. We find that whenever one group's costs are higher than the other's, the learner's equilibrium strategy exhibits an inequality-reinforcing phenomenon wherein the learner erroneously admits some members of the advantaged group, while erroneously excluding some members of the disadvantaged group. We also consider the effects of interventions in which a learner subsidizes members of the disadvantaged group, lowering their costs in order to improve her own classification performance.

However, CNNs still suffer from a tendency to confidently classify out-distribution samples from unknown classes into pre-defined known classes. Further, they are also vulnerable to adversarial examples. We are relating these two issues through the tendency of CNNs to over-generalize for areas of the input space not covered well by the training set. We show that a CNN augmented with an extra output class can act as a simple yet effective end-to-end model for controlling over-generalization. As an appropriate training set for the extra class, we introduce two resources that are computationally efficient to obtain: a representative natural out-distribution set and interpolated in-distribution samples. To help select a representative natural out-distribution set among available ones, we propose a simple measurement to assess an out-distribution set's fitness. We also demonstrate that training such an augmented CNN with representative out-distribution natural datasets and some interpolated samples allows it to better handle a wide range of unseen out-distribution samples and black-box adversarial examples without training it on any adversaries. Finally, we show that generation of white-box adversarial attacks using our proposed augmented CNN can become harder, as the attack algorithms have to get around the rejection regions when generating actual adversaries.

Structures are tracked based on the optimal matching between persistence diagrams with respect to the Wasserstein metric. This fundamentally relies on solving the assignment problem, a special case of optimal transport, for all consecutive timesteps. Our approach relies on two main contributions. First, we revisit the seminal assignment algorithm by Kuhn and Munkres which we specifically adapt to the problem of matching persistence diagrams in an efficient way. Second, we propose an extension of the Wasserstein metric that significantly improves the geometrical stability of the matching of domain-embedded persistence pairs. We show that this geometrical lifting has the additional positive side-effect of improving the assignment matrix sparsity and therefore computing time. The global framework implements a coarse-grained parallelism by computing persistence diagrams and finding optimal matchings in parallel for every couple of consecutive timesteps. Critical trajectories are constructed by associating successively matched persistence pairs over time. Merging and splitting events are detected with a geometrical threshold in a post-processing stage. Extensive experiments on real-life datasets show that our matching approach is an order of magnitude faster than the seminal Munkres algorithm. Moreover, compared to a modern approximation method, our method provides competitive runtimes while yielding exact results. We demonstrate the utility of our global framework by extracting critical point trajectories from various simulated time-varying datasets and compare it to the existing methods based on associated overlaps of volumes. Robustness to noise and temporal resolution downsampling is empirically demonstrated. ",Lifted Wasserstein Matcher for Fast and Robust Topology Tracking

Its input-output relation is considered to be stochastic, being described for a given input by a parameterized conditional probability distribution of outputs. The space of parameters consisting of weights and biases is a Riemannian manifold, where the metric is defined by the Fisher information matrix. The natural gradient method uses the steepest descent direction in a Riemannian manifold, so it is effective in learning, avoiding plateaus. It requires inversion of the Fisher information matrix, however, which is practically impossible when the matrix has a huge number of dimensions. Many methods for approximating the natural gradient have therefore been introduced. The present paper uses statistical neurodynamical method to reveal the properties of the Fisher information matrix in a net of random connections under the mean field approximation. We prove that the Fisher information matrix is unit-wise block diagonal supplemented by small order terms of off-block-diagonal elements, which provides a justification for the quasi-diagonal natural gradient method by Y. Ollivier. A unitwise block-diagonal Fisher metrix reduces to the tensor product of the Fisher information matrices of single units. We further prove that the Fisher information matrix of a single unit has a simple reduced form, a sum of a diagonal matrix and a rank 2 matrix of weight-bias correlations. We obtain the inverse of Fisher information explicitly. We then have an explicit form of the natural gradient, without relying on the numerical matrix inversion, which drastically speeds up stochastic gradient learning.

This is due to their abundance as well as their small radii and low masses and temperatures, which facilitate the detection of temperate, rocky planets in orbit around them. However, the fundamental properties of M dwarfs are difficult to constrain, often limiting our ability to characterise the planets they host. Here we test several theoretical relationships for M dwarfs by measuring 23 high precision, model-independent masses and radii for M dwarfs in binaries with white dwarfs. We find a large scatter in the radii of these low-mass stars, with 25 per cent having radii consistent with theoretical models while the rest are up to 12 per cent over-inflated. This scatter is seen in both partially- and fully-convective M dwarfs. No clear trend is seen between the over-inflation and age or metallicity, but there are indications that the radii of slowly rotating M dwarfs are more consistent with predictions, albeit with a similar amount of scatter in the measurements compared to more rapidly rotating M dwarfs. The sample of M dwarfs in close binaries with white dwarfs appears indistinguishable from other M dwarf samples, implying that common envelope evolution has a negligible impact on their structure. We conclude that theoretical and empirical mass-radius relationships lack the precision and accuracy required to measure the fundamental parameters of M dwarfs well enough to determine the internal structure and bulk composition of the planets they host.

Among them, the model with a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken power-law emissivity gives the statistically best fit and physically most plausible results.

Our current knowledge of metallicity-dependent CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor suggests that variations in the conversion factor cannot be responsible for the dust-to-metals ratio trends we observe.

For low planet masses we show that our simulations accurately model the evolution of inclined planet orbit (up to moderate inclinations). For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is separated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet orbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc. Due to the inclination of the planet, a warp develops across the planet orbit such that there is a relative tilt and twist between these discs. We show that when other parameters are held constant, the relative inclination that develops between the inner and outer disc depends on the outer radius of the total disc modelled.

In particular, we show that the gate count of the algorithm scales with the system size better than existing algorithms when $\alpha>3D$ (where $D$ is the number of dimensions).

We'd love to hear your comments! <LINK>""]",https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.00023,"The nascent field of fair machine learning aims to ensure that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the last several years, three formal definitions of fairness have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification, meaning that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their proxies---are not explicitly used to make decisions; (2) classification parity, meaning that common measures of predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the protected attributes; and (3) calibration, meaning that conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are independent of protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical limitations. Requiring anti-classification or classification parity can, perversely, harm the very groups they were designed to protect; and calibration, though generally desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are equitable. In contrast to these formal fairness criteria, we argue that it is often preferable to treat similarly risky people similarly, based on the most statistically accurate estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy, while not universally applicable, often aligns well with policy objectives; notably, this strategy will typically violate both anti-classification and classification parity. In practice, it requires significant effort to construct suitable risk estimates. One must carefully define and measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms satisfy popular mathematical formalizations of fairness.

In multi-planet systems that host giant planets, the perturbation of the protoplanetary disk strongly affects the migration of companion planets. By studying the well-characterized resonant planetary system around GJ 876 we aim to explore which effects shape disk-driven migration in such a multi-planet system to form resonant chains. We modelled the orbital migration of three planets embedded in a protoplanetary disk using two-dimensional locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations. We performed a parameter study by varying the disk thickness, $\alpha$ viscosity, mass as well as the initial position of the planets. Moreover, we have analysed and compared simulations with various boundary conditions at the disk's inner rim. We find that due to the high masses of the giant planets, substantial eccentricity can be excited in the disk. This results in large variations of the torque acting on the outer lower-mass planet, which we attribute to a shift of Lindblad and corotation resonances due to disk eccentricity. Depending on disk parameters, the migration of the outer planet can be stopped in a non-resonant state. In other models, the outer planet is able to open a partial gap and to circularize the disk again, later entering a 2:1 resonance with the most massive planet in the system to complete the observed Laplace resonance. Disk-mediated interactions between planets due to spiral waves and excitation of disk eccentricity cause deviations from smooth inward migration of exterior lower mass planets. Self-consistent modelling of the disk-driven migration of multi-planet systems is thus mandatory. Our results are compatible with a late migration of the outermost planet into the resonant chain, when the giant planet pair already is in resonance.

However, if a star has dark starspots (or bright regions) distributed throughout the transit chord, the transit depth will be biased towards smaller (larger) values, and thus the inferred planet radius will be smaller (larger) if unaccounted for. We reparameterize the transit light curve to account for ""self-contamination"" by photospheric inhomogeneities by splitting the parameter $R_p/R_\star$ into two parameters: one for the radius ratio -- which controls the duration of ingress and egress -- and another which measures the possibly contaminated transit depth. We show that this is equivalent to the formulation for contamination by a second star (with positive or negative flux), and that it is sensitive to time-steady inhomogeneity of the stellar photosphere. We use synthetic light curves of spotted stars at high signal-to-noise to show that the radius recovered from measurement of the ingress/egress duration can recover the true radii of planets transiting spotted stars with axisymmetric spot distributions if the limb-darkening parameters are precisely known. We fit time-averaged high signal-to-noise transit light curves from Kepler and Spitzer of ten planets to measure the planet radii and search for evidence of spot distributions. We find that this sample has a range of measured depths and ingress durations which are self-consistent, providing no strong evidence for contamination by spots. However, there is suggestive evidence for occultation of starspots on Kepler-17, and that relatively bright regions are occulted by the planets of Kepler-412 and HD 80606.

The case of $0$-dimensional homology ($i=0$) relates to work by Michael J Steele (1988) studying the total length of a minimal spanning tree on a random sampling of points. Indeed, if $\mu$ is supported on a compact subset of Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^m$ for $m\ge2$, then Steele's work implies that $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathrm{PH}}^0(\mu)=m$ if the absolutely continuous part of $\mu$ has positive mass, and otherwise $\mathrm{dim}_{\mathrm{PH}}^0(\mu)<m$. Experiments suggest that similar results may be true for higher-dimensional homology $0<i<m$, though this is an open question. Our fractal dimension is defined by considering a limit, as the number of points $n$ goes to infinity, of the total sum of the $i$-dimensional persistent homology interval lengths for $n$ random points selected from $\mu$ in an i.i.d. fashion. To some measures $\mu,$ we are able to assign a finer invariant, a curve measuring the limiting distribution of persistent homology interval lengths as the number of points goes to infinity. We prove this limiting curve exists in the case of $0$-dimensional homology when $\mu$ is the uniform distribution over the unit interval, and conjecture that it exists when $\mu$ is the rescaled probability measure for a compact set in Euclidean space with positive Lebesgue measure.

These properties constrain the structure of the core quite severely --- even if the core of a cubelike graph is not actually cubelike, it must bear a very close resemblance to a cubelike graph. Moreover we prove the much stronger result that not only are these properties inherited by the core of a cubelike graph, but also by the orbital graphs of the core. Even though the core and its orbital graphs look very much like cubelike graphs, we are unable to show that this is sufficient to characterise cubelike graphs. However, our results are strong enough to eliminate all non-cubelike vertex-transitive graphs on up to $32$ vertices as potential cores of cubelike graphs (of any size).

Particularly interesting is to constrain the properties of planets between the Earth and Neptune in size, the most abundant type of planets orbiting Sun-like stars with periods less than a few years. Among many other K2 candidates, we discovered a multi-planetary system around EPIC246471491, with four planets ranging in size from twice the size of Earth, to nearly the size of Neptune. We measure the mass of the planets of the EPIC246471491 system by means of precise radial velocity measurements using the CARMENES spectrograph and the HARPS-N spectrograph. With our data we are able to determine the mass of the two inner planets of the system with a precision better than 15%, and place upper limits on the masses of the two outer planets. We find that EPIC246471491b has a mass of 9.68 Me, and a radius of 2.59 Re, yielding a mean density of 3.07 g/cm3, while EPIC246471491c has a mass of 15.68 Me, radius of 3.53 Re, and a mean density of 19.5 g/cm3. For EPIC246471491d (R=2.48Re) and EPIC246471491e (R=1.95Re) the upper limits for the masses are 6.5 and 10.7 Me, respectively. The system is thus composed of a nearly Neptune-twin planet (in mass and radius), two sub-Neptunes with very different densities and presumably bulk composition, and a fourth planet in the outermost orbit that resides right in the middle of the super-Earth/sub-Neptune radius gap.

Our model starts with a poloidal field, and fully resolves the most unstable mode of the magnetorotational instability.

When attempting to remove such demographic information using adversarial training, we find that while the adversarial component achieves chance-level development-set accuracy during training, a post-hoc classifier, trained on the encoded sentences from the first part, still manages to reach substantially higher classification accuracies on the same data. This behavior is consistent across several tasks, demographic properties and datasets. We explore several techniques to improve the effectiveness of the adversarial component. Our main conclusion is a cautionary one: do not rely on the adversarial training to achieve invariant representation to sensitive features.

The galaxy harbours a dusty disc of cool gas and is surrounded by an extended hot X-ray emitting gaseous atmosphere with unusually high central entropy. The hot gas in the plane of rotation of the cool dusty disc has a multi-temperature structure, consistent with ongoing cooling. We conclude that the rotational support of the hot gas is likely capable of altering the multiphase condensation regardless of the $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ ratio, which is here relatively high, $\sim 40$.

Models of agent responsiveness, termed ""strategic manipulation,"" analyze the interaction between a learner and agents in a world where all agents are equally able to manipulate their features in an attempt to ""trick"" a published classifier. In cases of real world classification, however, an agent's ability to adapt to an algorithm is not simply a function of her personal interest in receiving a positive classification, but is bound up in a complex web of social factors that affect her ability to pursue certain action responses. In this paper, we adapt models of strategic manipulation to capture dynamics that may arise in a setting of social inequality wherein candidate groups face different costs to manipulation. We find that whenever one group's costs are higher than the other's, the learner's equilibrium strategy exhibits an inequality-reinforcing phenomenon wherein the learner erroneously admits some members of the advantaged group, while erroneously excluding some members of the disadvantaged group. We also consider the effects of interventions in which a learner subsidizes members of the disadvantaged group, lowering their costs in order to improve her own classification performance. Here we encounter a paradoxical result: there exist cases in which providing a subsidy improves only the learner's utility while actually making both candidate groups worse-off--even the group receiving the subsidy.

We evaluate energy consumption on four different networks based on the two most popular ones (ResNet/AlexNet): ResNet (167 layers), a 2D CNN (15 layers), a CaffeNet (25 layers) and a ResNetIm (94 layers) using batch sizes of 64, 128 and 256, and then correlate those with speed-up and accuracy to determine optimal settings. Experimental results on a multi-GPU server endowed with twin Maxwell and twin Pascal Titan X GPUs demonstrate that energy correlates with performance and that Pascal may have up to 40% gains versus Maxwell. Larger batch sizes extend performance gains and energy savings, but we have to keep an eye on accuracy, which sometimes shows a preference for small batches. We expect this work to provide a preliminary guidance for a wide set of CNN and DL applications in modern HPC times, where the GFLOPS/w ratio constitutes the primary goal.
