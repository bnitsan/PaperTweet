Bandeira,"['New paper, with Tim Kunisky, about the space of feasible solutions for the Degree 4 SOS relaxation of the quadratic program arising, e.g., in Max-Cut: <LINK>']",https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11583,"One of the most widely studied convex relaxations in combinatorial optimization is the relaxation of the cut polytope $\mathscr C^N$ to the elliptope $\mathscr E^N$, which corresponds to the degree 2 sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxation of optimizing a quadratic form over the hypercube $\{\pm 1\}^N$. We study the extension of this classical idea to degree 4 SOS, which gives an intermediate relaxation we call the degree 4 generalized elliptope $\mathscr E_4^N$. Our main result is a necessary and sufficient condition for the Gram matrix of a collection of vectors to belong to $\mathscr E_4^N$. Consequences include a tight rank inequality between degree 2 and degree 4 pseudomoment matrices, and a guarantee that the only extreme points of $\mathscr E^N$ also in $\mathscr E_4^N$ are the cut matrices; that is, $\mathscr E^N$ and $\mathscr E_4^N$ share no ""spurious"" extreme point. For Gram matrices of equiangular tight frames, we give a simple criterion for membership in $\mathscr{E}_4^N$. This yields new inequalities satisfied in $\mathscr{E}_4^N$ but not $\mathscr{E}^N$ whose structure is related to the Schl\""{a}fli graph and which cannot be obtained as linear combinations of triangle inequalities. We also give a new proof of the restriction to degree 4 of a result of Laurent showing that $\mathscr{E}_4^N$ does not satisfy certain cut polytope inequalities capturing parity constraints. Though limited to this special case, our proof of the positive semidefiniteness of Laurent's pseudomoment matrix is short and elementary. Our techniques also suggest that membership in $\mathscr{E}_4^N$ is closely related to the partial transpose operation on block matrices, which has previously played an important role in the study of quantum entanglement. To illustrate, we present a correspondence between certain entangled bipartite quantum states and the matrices of $\mathscr{E}_4^N\setminus\mathscr{C}^N$.

In their approach to collective behaviors, these approaches transcend traditional studies of group decision making that focus on how individual preferences combine through power relationships, social choice by voting, negotiation and game theory. Understanding more generally how individuals contribute to group effectiveness is important to a broad set of social challenges. Here we formalize a dynamic theory of interpersonal communications that classifies individual acts, sequences of actions, group behavioral patterns, and individuals engaged in group decision making. Group decision making occurs through a sequence of communications that convey personal attitudes and preferences among members of the group. The resulting formalism is relevant to psychosocial behavior analysis, rules of order, organizational structures and personality types, as well as formalized systems such as social choice theory. More centrally, it provides a framework for quantifying and even anticipating the structure of informal dialog, allowing specific conversations to be coded and analyzed in relation to a quantitative model of the participating individuals and the parameters that govern their interactions.

An extension of our paper ""Explaining Aggregates for Exploratory Analytics"" with extra experiments, metrics and more is now available in arXiv : <LINK>']",https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11346,"Analysts wishing to explore multivariate data spaces, typically pose queries involving selection operators, i.e., range or radius queries, which define data subspaces of possible interest and then use aggregation functions, the results of which determine their exploratory analytics interests. However, such aggregate query (AQ) results are simple scalars and as such, convey limited information about the queried subspaces for exploratory analysis. We address this shortcoming aiding analysts to explore and understand data subspaces by contributing a novel explanation mechanism coined XAXA: eXplaining Aggregates for eXploratory Analytics. XAXA's novel AQ explanations are represented using functions obtained by a three-fold joint optimization problem. Explanations assume the form of a set of parametric piecewise-linear functions acquired through a statistical learning model. A key feature of the proposed solution is that model training is performed by only monitoring AQs and their answers on-line. In XAXA, explanations for future AQs can be computed without any database (DB) access and can be used to further explore the queried data subspaces, without issuing any more queries to the DB. We evaluate the explanation accuracy and efficiency of XAXA through theoretically grounded metrics over real-world and synthetic datasets and query workloads.

We attempt to constrain the explosion mechanism (neutron-star-forming implosion or thermonuclear explosion) and the frequency of occurrence of ECSNe using nucleosynthesis simulations of the latter scenario, population synthesis, the solar abundance distribution, pre-solar meteoritic oxide grain isotopic ratio measurements and the white dwarf mass-radius relation. Tracer particles from 3d hydrodynamic simulations were post-processed with a large nuclear reaction network in order to determine the complete compositional state of the bound ONeFe remnant and the ejecta, and population synthesis simulations were performed in order to estimate the ECSN rate with respect to the CCSN rate. The 3d deflagration simulations drastically overproduce the neutron-rich isotopes $^{48}$Ca, $^{50}$Ti, $^{54}$Cr, $^{60}$Fe and several of the Zn isotopes relative to their solar abundances. Using the solar abundance distribution as our constraint, we place an upper limit on the frequency of thermonuclear ECSNe as 1$-$3~\% the frequency at which core-collapse supernovae (FeCCSNe) occur. This is on par with or 1~dex lower than the estimates for ECSNe from single stars. The upper limit from the yields is also in relatively good agreement with the predictions from our population synthesis simulations. The $^{54}$Cr/$^{52}$Cr and $^{50}$Ti/$^{48}$Ti isotopic ratios in the ejecta are a near-perfect match with recent measurements of extreme pre-solar meteoritc oxide grains, and $^{53}$Cr/$^{52}$Cr can also be matched if the ejecta condenses before mixing with the interstellar medium. Theoretical mass-radius relations for the bound ONeFe WD remnants of these explosions are apparently consistent with several observational WD candidates.

Combining this information with transit data furthermore yields the corresponding parameters for their exoplanets. While [Fe/H] and Teff are commonly stated to a precision of ~0.1 dex and ~100 K, the impact of errors in their measurement has not been studied in practice within the context of the parameters derived from them. Here we use the Stellar Parameters in an Instant (SPI) pipeline to estimate the parameters of nearly 100 stars observed by Kepler and Gaia, many of which are confirmed planet hosts. We adjust the reported spectroscopic measurements of these stars by introducing faux systematic errors and artificially increasing the reported uncertainties, and quantify the differences in the resulting parameters. We find that a systematic error of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] translates to differences of only 4%, 2%, and 1% on average in the resulting stellar ages, masses, and radii, which are well within their uncertainties (~11%, 3.5%, 1.4%) as derived by SPI. We also find that increasing the uncertainty of [Fe/H] measurements by 0.1 dex increases the uncertainties by only 0.01 Gyr, 0.02 M_sun, and 0.01 R_sun, which are again well below their reported uncertainties (0.5 Gyr, 0.04 M_sun, 0.02 R_sun).

We compare to observed relations derived from integral field unit surveys and imaging of galaxies. EAGLE reproduces the slope of the local ($z\approx0.1$) rSFMS well, but with a $\approx-0.15$ dex offset, close to that found for the galaxy-integrated relation. The shape of the rMZR agrees reasonably well with observations, replicating the characteristic turnover at high surface density, which we show is due to AGN feedback. The residuals of the rSFMS and rMZR are negatively (positively) correlated at low (high) surface density. The rSFMS becomes shallower as the simulation evolves from $z=2$ to 0.1, a manifestation of inside-out galaxy formation. The shape of the rMZR also exhibits dramatic evolution, from a convex profile at $z=2$ to the observed concave profile at $z=0.1$, such that the gas in regions of high stellar density is more enriched at higher redshift. The redshift independence of the relationship between the galaxy-wide gas fraction and metallicity in EAGLE galaxies is not preserved on 1 kpc scales, implying that chemical evolution is non-local due to the transport of gas and metals within galaxies.

This paper empirically investigates the security guarantee of this technique, which is introduced as the problem of model completion: Given the entire training data set or an environment simulator, and a subset of the parameters of a trained deep learning model, how much training is required to recover the model's original performance? We define a metric for evaluating the hardness of the model completion problem and study it empirically in both supervised learning on ImageNet and reinforcement learning on Atari and DeepMind~Lab. Our experiments show that (1) the model completion problem is harder in reinforcement learning than in supervised learning because of the unavailability of the trained agent's trajectories, and (2) its hardness depends not primarily on the number of parameters of the missing part, but more so on their type and location.

We show that without accounting for correlation between the density at observer's location and the weak gravitational lensing spectra, the values of the parameters $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$ are underestimated by a few percent.

For example, when the graph is irregular and the initial state is the typical uniform superposition over the vertices, then the success probability can vary greatly from one timestep to the next, even alternating between 0 and 1, so the precise time at which measurement occurs is crucial. When the initial state is a uniform superposition over the edges, however, the success probability evolves smoothly. As another example, if the complete bipartite graph is regular, then the two initial states are equivalent. Then if two marked vertices are in the same partite set, the success probability reaches 1/2, but if they are in different partite sets, it instead reaches $1$. This differs from the complete graph, which is the quantum walk formulation of Grover's algorithm, where the success probability with two marked vertices is 8/9.

One considers the loss in information one would incur in selecting the wrong graph, while the second penalises for large number of edges, favouring sparsity. We illustrate the prior on simulated data and on real datasets, and compare the results with other priors on $G$ used in the literature. Moreover, we present a default choice of the prior as well as discuss how it can be calibrated so as to reflect available prior information. ",A Loss-Based Prior for Gaussian Graphical Models

The complexity of the region makes the identification of the origin of the very-high energy emission difficult, however the spectral agreement with the LAT source and overlapping position at less than 1.5$\sigma$ point to a common origin. We analysed 8 years of \fermi-LAT data to extend the spectrum of the source down to 60\,MeV. \fermi-LAT and MAGIC spectra overlap within errors and the global broad band spectrum is described by a power-law with exponential cutoff at $1.9\pm0.5$\,TeV.

We also explore several alternative designs, including the modifications of the nominal detector to increase signal yield, and combining this detector technology with existing and planned neutrino detectors to better search for minicharged particles. The CERN SPS beam and associated experimental structure also provide a similar alternative.

For each galaxy, the MaNGA pipelines produce relatively large data files to preserve the spatial correlations of the spectra and measurements, but this comes at the expense of storing the data set in a coarsely-chunked manner. The coarse chunking and total volume of the data make it time-consuming to download and curate locally-stored data.

Since these statistical techniques fit models to low-dimensional measurements from brains, they ignore the fact that brain activity is high-dimensional. Here we focus on the obvious confound of common inputs: the countless unobserved variables likely have more influence than the few observed ones. Any given observed correlation can be explained by an infinite set of causal models that take into account the unobserved variables. Therefore, correlations within massively undersampled measurements tell us little about mechanisms.

We have previously reported that emission from an extended corona with a low polarization fraction is dominating, and that the polarization angle is perpendicular to the disk surface. In the soft gamma-ray regime, a highly-polarized synchrotron jet is reported with INTEGRAL observations. To constrain the polarization fraction and flux of such a jet component in the hard X-ray regime, we now extend analyses through vector calculations in the Stokes QU plane, where the dominant corona emission and the jet component are considered simultaneously. The presence of another emission component with different polarization angle could partly cancel out the net polarization. The 90% upper limit of the polarization fraction for the additional synchrotron jet component is estimated as <10%, <5%, and <5% for polarization angle perpendicular to the disk surface, parallel to the surface, and aligned with the emission reported by INTEGRAL data, respectively.

This requires a system to reason about its own uncertainty given unfamiliar, out-of-distribution observations. Approximate Bayesian approaches are commonly used to estimate uncertainty for neural network predictions, but can struggle with out-of-distribution observations. Generative models can in principle detect out-of-distribution observations as those with a low estimated density. However, the mere presence of an out-of-distribution input does not by itself indicate an unsafe situation. In this paper, we present a method for uncertainty-aware robotic perception that combines generative modeling and model uncertainty to cope with uncertainty stemming from out-of-distribution states. Our method estimates an uncertainty measure about the model's prediction, taking into account an explicit (generative) model of the observation distribution to handle out-of-distribution inputs. This is accomplished by probabilistically projecting observations onto the training distribution, such that out-of-distribution inputs map to uncertain in-distribution observations, which in turn produce uncertain task-related predictions, but only if task-relevant parts of the image change. We evaluate our method on an action-conditioned collision prediction task with both simulated and real data, and demonstrate that our method of projecting out-of-distribution observations improves the performance of four standard Bayesian and non-Bayesian neural network approaches, offering more favorable trade-offs between the proportion of time a robot can remain autonomous and the proportion of impending crashes successfully avoided.

We reveal that the traditional Drude approximation is not equipped to fit spectra from a heterogeneous ensemble of doped semiconductor NCs and produces fit results that violate Mie scattering theory. The heterogeneous ensemble Drude approximation (HEDA) model rectifies this issue by accounting for ensemble heterogeneity and near-surface depletion. The HEDA model is applied to tin-doped indium oxide NCs for a range of sizes and doping levels but we expect it can be employed for any isotropic plasmonic particles in the quasistatic regime. It captures individual NC optical properties and their contributions to the ensemble spectra thereby enabling the analysis of intrinsic NC properties from an ensemble measurement.

Our models include a component to model the transit light source effect (spectral contamination from unocculted spots on the stellar photosphere), which we show can have a marked impact on the observed transmission spectrum for reasonable spot covering fractions (< 5%); this is the first such analysis for WASP-4b. We are also able to fit for the size and temperature contrast of spots observed during the second and third transits, finding evidence for both small, cool and large, warm spot-like features on the photosphere. Finally, we compare our results to those published by Huitson et al. (2017) using Gemini/GMOS and May et al. (2018) using IMACS, and find that our data are in agreement.

Our results are consistent with existing literature and can be regarded as a fully-ab initio derivation of a Schwinger-Keldysh effective action. In addition, we provide a simple infrared effective action for the near horizon region that drives all the dissipation and can be viewed as an alternative to the membrane paradigm approximation.

The star cluster catalogues are from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) and the molecular clouds from the Plateau de Bure Interefrometer Arcsecond Whirpool Survey (PAWS). We find that younger star clusters are spatially closer to molecular clouds than older star clusters. The median ages for clusters associated with clouds is 4~Myr whereas it is 50~Myr for clusters that are sufficiently separated from a molecular cloud to be considered unassociated. After $\sim$6~Myr, the majority of the star clusters lose association with their molecular gas. Younger star clusters are also preferentially located in stellar spiral arms where they are hierarchically distributed in kpc-size regions for 50-100~Myr before dispersing. The youngest star clusters are more strongly clustered, yielding a two-point correlation function with $\alpha=-0.28\pm0.04$, than the GMCs ($\alpha=-0.09\pm0.03$) within the same PAWS field. However, the clustering strength of the most massive GMCs, supposedly the progenitors of the young clusters for a star formation efficiency of a few percent, is comparable ($\alpha=-0.35\pm0.05$) to that of the clusters. We find a galactocentric-dependence for the coherence of star formation, in which clusters located in the inner region of the galaxy reside in smaller star-forming complexes and display more homogeneous distributions than clusters further from the centre. This result suggests a correlation between the survival of a cluster complex and its environment. ","The Spatial Relation between Young Star Clusters and Molecular Clouds in

Our method, dubbed SiamMask, improves the offline training procedure of popular fully-convolutional Siamese approaches for object tracking by augmenting their loss with a binary segmentation task. Once trained, SiamMask solely relies on a single bounding box initialisation and operates online, producing class-agnostic object segmentation masks and rotated bounding boxes at 55 frames per second. Despite its simplicity, versatility and fast speed, our strategy allows us to establish a new state of the art among real-time trackers on VOT-2018, while at the same time demonstrating competitive performance and the best speed for the semi-supervised video object segmentation task on DAVIS-2016 and DAVIS-2017.

The resulting catalogue improves upon previous catalogues in its handling of spurious detections by taking into account XMM-Newton quality flags. We estimate the contamination of ULXs by background sources to be 24 per cent. We define a 'complete' subsample as those ULXs in galaxies for which the sensitivity limit is below $10^{39}$ erg/s and use it to examine the hardness ratio properties between ULX and non-ULX sources, and ULXs in different classes of host galaxy. We find that ULXs have a similar hardness ratio distribution to lower-luminosity sources, consistent with previous studies. We also find that ULXs in spiral and elliptical host galaxies have similar distributions to each other independent of host galaxy morphology, however our results do support previous indications that the population of ULXs is more luminous in star-forming host galaxies than in non-star-forming galaxies. Our catalogue contains further interesting subpopulations for future study, including Eddington Threshold sources and highly variable ULXs. We also examine the highest-luminosity (L$_X$ > $5 \times 10^{40}$ erg/s) ULXs in our catalogue in search of intermediate-mass black hole candidates, and find nine new possible candidates.

We show theoretically and empirically that this new family of hash functions is locality-sensitive and preserves rank similarity for inputs in any `p space. We then analyze different variations on this strategy and show empirically that they outperform existing LSH methods for nearest-neighbors search on six benchmark datasets. Finally, we propose a multi-probe version of our algorithm that achieves higher performance for the same query time, or conversely, that maintains performance of prior approaches while taking significantly less indexing time and memory.

Accordingly, there is a pressing need for robust tools to detect and classify Islamophobic hate speech at scale. Previous research has largely approached the detection of Islamophobic hate speech on social media as a binary task. However, the varied nature of Islamophobia means that this is often inappropriate for both theoretically-informed social science and effectively monitoring social media. Drawing on in-depth conceptual work we build a multi-class classifier which distinguishes between non-Islamophobic, weak Islamophobic and strong Islamophobic content. Accuracy is 77.6% and balanced accuracy is 83%. We apply the classifier to a dataset of 109,488 tweets produced by far right Twitter accounts during 2017. Whilst most tweets are not Islamophobic, weak Islamophobia is considerably more prevalent (36,963 tweets) than strong (14,895 tweets). Our main input feature is a gloVe word embeddings model trained on a newly collected corpus of 140 million tweets. It outperforms a generic word embeddings model by 5.9 percentage points, demonstrating the importan4ce of context.

It is hypothesized that the bar can either stabilize the gas against collapse, inhibiting star formation or efficiently consume all the available gas, with no fuel for further star formation. We present a multi-wavelength study using the archival data of an early-type barred spiral galaxy, Messier 95, which shows signatures of suppressed star formation in the bar-region. Using the optical, ultraviolet, infrared, CO and HI imaging data we study the pattern of star formation progression, stellar/gas distribution and try to provide insights on the process responsible for the observed pattern. The FUV$-$NUV pixel colour map reveals a cavity devoid of UV flux in the bar-region that interestingly matches with the length of the bar ($\sim$ 4.2kpc). The central nuclear region of the galaxy is showing a blue color clump and along the major-axis of the stellar bar the colour progressively becomes redder. Based on a comparison to single stellar population models, we show that the region of galaxy along the major-axis of the bar (unlike the region outside the bar) is comprised of stellar populations with ages $\geq$ 350 Myr, with a star-forming clump in the center of younger ages ($\sim$ 150Myr). Interestingly the bar-region is also devoid of neutral and molecular hydrogen but with an abundant molecular hydrogen present at the nuclear region of the galaxy. Our results are consistent with a picture in which the stellar bar in Messier 95 is redistributing the gas by funneling gas inflows to nuclear region, thus making the bar-region devoid of fuel for star formation.
