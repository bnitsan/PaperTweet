First, MCMC is run in parallel on (sub)posteriors defined on data partitions. Then, a server combines local results. While efficient, this framework is very sensitive to the quality of subposterior sampling. Common sampling problems such as missing modes or misrepresentation of low-density regions are amplified -- instead of being corrected -- in the combination phase, leading to catastrophic failures. In this work, we propose a novel combination strategy to mitigate this issue. Our strategy, Parallel Active Inference (PAI), leverages Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate modeling and active learning. After fitting GPs to subposteriors, PAI (i) shares information between GP surrogates to cover missing modes; and (ii) uses active sampling to individually refine subposterior approximations. We validate PAI in challenging benchmarks, including heavy-tailed and multi-modal posteriors and a real-world application to computational neuroscience. Empirical results show that PAI succeeds where previous methods catastrophically fail, with a small communication overhead. ",Parallel MCMC Without Embarrassing Failures

The second stage is to learn similar representations within the same cluster and dissimilar representations for data from different clusters. Our empirical experiments suggest the following three contributions. First, compared to conventional self-supervised representations, the auxiliary-information-infused representations bring the performance closer to the supervised representations, which use direct downstream labels as supervision signals. Second, our approach performs the best in most cases, when comparing our approach with other baseline representation learning methods that also leverage auxiliary data information.

However, there has not been an extensive study of how the convergence behavior is affected by the choice of the basis functions. In particular, it remains an open question if localized basis functions might perform better. In this work, we implement, tune, and validate Daubechies wavelets as basis functions for VES\@. The wavelets construct orthogonal and localized bases that exhibit an attractive multiresolution property. We evaluate the performance of wavelet and other basis functions on various systems, going from model potentials to the calcium carbonate association process in water. We observe that wavelets exhibit excellent performance and much more robust convergence behavior than all other basis functions, as well as better performance than metadynamics. In particular, using wavelet bases yields far smaller fluctuations of the bias potential within individual runs and smaller differences between independent runs. Based on our overall results, we can recommend wavelets as basis functions for VES. ","Improving the Efficiency of Variationally Enhanced Sampling with

The surface code and its variants have been considered the most promising quantum error correction scheme due to their high threshold, low overhead, and relatively simple structure that can naturally be implemented in many existing qubit architectures, such as superconducting qubits. The recent development of Floquet codes offers another promising approach. By going beyond the usual paradigm of stabilizer codes, Floquet codes achieve similar performance while being constructed entirely from two-qubit measurements. This makes them particularly suitable for platforms where two-qubit measurements can be implemented directly, such as measurement-only topological qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we explain how two variants of Floquet codes can be implemented on MZM-based architectures without any auxiliary qubits for syndrome measurement and with shallow syndrome extraction sequences. We then numerically demonstrate their favorable performance. In particular, we show that they improve the threshold for scalable quantum computation in MZM-based systems by an order of magnitude, and significantly reduce space and time overheads below threshold.

We add a new viewpoint by giving operationally motivated bounds on several capacities, including the quantum capacity and private capacity of a quantum channel and the one-way distillable entanglement and private key of a quantum state. These bounds are generally phrased in terms of capacity quantities involving the complementary channel or state. As a tool to obtain these bounds, we discuss partial orders on quantum channels and states, such as the less noisy and the more capable order. Our bounds help to further understand the interplay between different capacities, as they give operational limitations on superadditivity and the difference between capacities in terms of the information-theoretic properties of the complementary channel or state.

In this work, we revisit reported observational evidence for radial migration and quantify its strength using the age--[Fe/H] distribution of stars across the Milky Way with APOGEE data. We find a broken age--[Fe/H] relation in the Galactic disc at $r>6$ kpc, with a more pronounced break at larger radii. To quantify the strength of radial migration, we assume stars born at each radius have a unique age and metallicity, and then decompose the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of mono-age young populations into different Gaussian components that originated from various birth radii at $r_{\rm birth}<13$ kpc. We find that, at ages of 2 and 3 Gyr, roughly half the stars were formed within 1 kpc of their present radius, and very few stars ($<5$%) were formed more than 4 kpc away from their present radius. These results suggest limited short distance radial migration and inefficient long distance migration in the Milky Way during the last 3 Gyr. In the very outer disc beyond 15~kpc, the observed age--[Fe/H] distribution is consistent with the prediction of pure radial migration from smaller radii, suggesting a migration origin of the very outer disc. We also estimate intrinsic metallicity gradients at ages of 2 and 3 Gyr of $-0.061$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ and $-0.063$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, respectively.

As the title suggests we take a modern topological point of view and prove the generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem by making use of a topological index (which coincides with the filling factor). By a topological index, we mean an index that characterizes a locally-unique gapped ground state and is invariant under continuous (or smooth) modification of the ground state. For models with discrete symmetry, we describe the basic idea of the most general proof based on the topological index introduced in the context of symmetry-protected topological phases. We start from background materials such as the classification of projective representations of the symmetry group.

LOFAR images are available for 188 of these giant ETGs (gETGs) and 146 (78%) of them are detected above a typical luminosity of ~10E21 W/Hz. They show a large spread in power, reaching up to ~10E26 W/Hz. We confirm a positive link between the stellar luminosity of gETGs and their median radio power, the detection rate, and the fraction of extended sources. About two-thirds (91) of the detected gETGs are unresolved, with sizes <4 kpc, confirming the prevalence of compact radio sources in local sources. Forty-six gETGs show extended emission on scales ranging from 4 to 340 kpc, at least 80% of which have a FRI class morphology. Based on the morphology and spectral index of the extended sources, ~30% of them might be remnant or restarted sources but further studies are needed to confirm this. Optical spectroscopy (available for 44 gETGs) indicates that for seven of them the nuclear gas is ionized by young stars suggesting a contribution to their radio emission from star forming regions. Their radio luminosities correspond to a star formation rate (SFR) in the range 0.1-8 Msun/yr and a median specific SFR of 0.8x10E-12 yr-1. The gas flowing toward the center of gETGs can accrete onto the supermassive black hole but also stall at larger radii and form new stars, an indication that feedback does not completely quench star formation.

First, we investigate its role in generalization. We refine the Neural Collapse conjecture into two separate conjectures: collapse on the train set (an optimization property) and collapse on the test distribution (a generalization property). We find that while Neural Collapse often occurs on the train set, it does not occur on the test set. We thus conclude that Neural Collapse is primarily an optimization phenomenon, with as-yet-unclear connections to generalization. Second, we investigate the role of Neural Collapse in feature learning. We show simple, realistic experiments where training longer leads to worse last-layer features, as measured by transfer-performance on a downstream task. This suggests that neural collapse is not always desirable for representation learning, as previously claimed. Finally, we give preliminary evidence of a ""cascading collapse"" phenomenon, wherein some form of Neural Collapse occurs not only for the last layer, but in earlier layers as well.

These distributions depend on the components of the tau-polarization vector. We give, for the first time, the general expression for the outgoing hadron (pion or rho meson) energy and angular differential cross section for the sequential $\nu_\tau A_Z \to \tau^-(\pi^- \nu_\tau, \rho^-\nu_\tau) X$ and $\bar\nu_\tau A_Z \to \tau^+(\pi^+ \bar\nu_\tau, \rho^+ \bar\nu_\tau) X$ reactions. Though all possible nuclear reaction mechanisms contribute to the distribution, it may be possible to isolate/enhance one of them by implementing appropriate selection criteria. For the case of the quasi-elastic reaction off oxygen and neutrino energies below 6 GeV, we show that the pion distributions are sensitive to the details of the tau-polarization components. We find significant differences between the full calculation, where the longitudinal and transverse components of the tau polarization vector vary with the energy and the scattering angle of the produced tau, and the simplified scheme in which the polarizations are set to one and zero (respective asymptotic values in the high energy regime). In addition to its potential impact on neutrino oscillation analyses, this result can be used to further test different nuclear models, since these observables provide complementary information to that obtained by means of the inclusive nuclear weak charged-current differential cross section. We also study the effects on the cross section of the $W_4$, $W_5$ nuclear structure functions, which contributions are proportional to the charged lepton mass, and therefore difficult to constrain in muon and electron neutrino experiments.

The sample complexity in semi-supervised learning has two parameters, the number of labeled examples and the number of unlabeled examples. We consider the complexity measures, $VC_U \leq dim_U \leq VC$ and $VC^*$, where $VC$ is the standard $VC$-dimension, $VC^*$ is its dual, and the other two measures appeared in Montasser et al. (2019). The best sample bound known for robust supervised PAC learning is $O(VC \cdot VC^*)$, and we will compare our sample bounds to $\Lambda$ which is the minimal number of labeled examples required by any robust supervised PAC learning algorithm. Our main results are the following: (1) in the realizable setting it is sufficient to have $O(VC_U)$ labeled examples and $O(\Lambda)$ unlabeled examples. (2) In the agnostic setting, let $\eta$ be the minimal agnostic error. The sample complexity depends on the resulting error rate. If we allow an error of $2\eta+\epsilon$, it is still sufficient to have $O(VC_U)$ labeled examples and $O(\Lambda)$ unlabeled examples. If we insist on having an error $\eta+\epsilon$ then $\Omega(dim_U)$ labeled examples are necessary, as in the supervised case. The above results show that there is a significant benefit in semi-supervised robust learning, as there are hypothesis classes with $VC_U=0$ and $dim_U$ arbitrary large. In supervised learning, having access only to labeled examples requires at least $\Lambda \geq dim_U$ labeled examples. Semi-supervised require only $O(1)$ labeled examples and $O(\Lambda)$ unlabeled examples. A byproduct of our result is that if we assume that the distribution is robustly realizable by a hypothesis class, then with respect to the 0-1 loss we can learn with only $O(VC_U)$ labeled examples, even if the $VC$ is infinite.

This phase shift can introduce additional distortions in the strains produced by the Type-II image of the binary black hole signals depending on the morphology of the signals, e.g., when they have contributions from higher harmonics, precession, eccentricity etc. The optical depth to the Type-II images is nearly the same as the strong lensing (from galaxies) and thus are very likely to be observed in the near future. In this work, we investigate the potential applicability of these distortions in helping identify Type-II signals from a single detection, and also the systematic biases that could arise in the inference of their parameters if they are unknowingly recovered with unlensed gravitational-wave templates. We show that at total network signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $\rho=20(50)$, individual Type-II images should be identifiable with log Bayes factor $\ln \mathcal{B} > 2$ for inclinations $ \iota > 5 \pi/12 (\pi/3) $.

We demonstrate that if neutrinos have yet undiscovered long-range interactions, the lensing pattern is significantly affected, rendering the lensing anomaly as a pure statistical fluctuation. Our results thus open up a window to link anomalous CMB lensing with present and future cosmological, astrophysical, and laboratory measurements of neutrino properties.

First, we train a classifier to identify the included frames in a segmentation, using speech representations from a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0. The optimal splitting points are then found by a probabilistic Divide-and-Conquer algorithm that progressively splits at the frame of lowest probability until all segments are below a pre-specified length. Experiments on MuST-C and mTEDx show that the translation of the segments produced by our method approaches the quality of the manual segmentation on 5 languages pairs.

This work introduces an approach to quantify pairwise and HOIs for multivariate rhythmic processes interacting across multiple time scales. We define the so-called O-information rate (OIR) as a new metric to assess HOIs for multivariate time series, and propose a framework to decompose it into measures quantifying Granger-causal and instantaneous influences, as well as to expand it in the frequency domain. The framework exploits the spectral representation of vector autoregressive and state-space models to assess synergistic and redundant interactions among groups of processes, both in specific bands and in the time domain after whole-band integration. Validation on simulated networks illustrates how the spectral OIR can highlight redundant and synergistic HOIs emerging at specific frequencies but not using time-domain measures. The application to physiological networks described by heart period, arterial pressure and respiration measured in healthy subjects during paced breathing, and to brain networks described by ECoG signals acquired in an animal experiment during anesthesia, document the capability of our approach to identify informational circuits relevant to well-defined cardiovascular oscillations and brain rhythms and related to specific physiological mechanisms of autonomic control and altered consciousness. The proposed framework allows a hierarchically-organized evaluation of time- and frequency-domain interactions in networks mapped by multivariate time series, and its high flexibility and scalability make it suitable to investigate networks beyond pairwise interactions in neuroscience, physiology and other fields.

We identify and quantify parametrically what we believe to be the main issue behind this difficulty. Namely, a large volume implies a shallow AdS minimum and hence a small uplift. The latter, if it relies on an anti-D3 in a throat, requires a large negative tadpole. As our main result, we provide a simple and explicit formula for what this tadpole has to be in order to control the most dangerous corrections. The fundamental ingredients are parameters specifying the desired quality of control. We comment on the interplay between our constraint and the tadpole conjecture. We also discuss directions for future work which could lead to LVS constructions satisfying the tadpole constraint with better control, as well as further challenges that may exist for the LVS.

The contrast in flux between flares and the photospheres of cool stars is maximized at ultraviolet wavelengths, and GJ 65 is the brightest and nearest flaring M dwarf system with significant GALEX coverage. It therefore represents the best opportunity to measure low energy flares with GALEX. We construct high cadence light curves from calibrated photon events and find 13 new flare events with NUV energies ranging from 10^28.5 - 10^29.5 ergs and recover one previously reported flare with an energy of 10^31 ergs. The newly reported flares are among the smallest M dwarf flares observed in the ultraviolet with sufficient time resolution to discern light curve morphology. The estimated flare frequency at these low energies is consistent with extrapolation from the distributions of higher-energy flares on active M dwarfs measured by other surveys. The largest flare in our sample is bright enough to exceed the local non-linearity threshold of the GALEX detectors, which precludes color analysis. However, we detect quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) during this flare in both the FUV and NUV bands at a period of ~50 seconds, which we interpret as a modulation of the flare's chromospheric thermal emission through periodic triggering of reconnection by external MHD oscillations in the corona.

Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.

We classify two fundamental types of CO line shapes interpreted as emission from Keplerian rings (double-peak lines) and a disk surface plus a low-velocity part of a wind (triangular lines), where CO excitation reflects different emitting regions (and their gas-to-dust ratio) rather than just the irradiation spectrum. A disk+wind interpretation for the triangular lines naturally explains several properties observed in CO spectra, including the line blue-shifts, line shapes that turn into narrow absorption at high inclinations, and the frequency of disk winds as a function of stellar type.

An increasingly popular alternative in e-commerce search is to issue a voice-query to a smart speaker (e.g., Amazon Echo) powered by a voice assistant (VA, e.g., Alexa). In this situation, the VA usually spells out the details of only one product, an explanation citing the reason for its selection, and a default action of adding the product to the customer's cart. This reduced autonomy of the customer in the choice of a product during voice-search makes it necessary for a VA to be far more responsible and trustworthy in its explanation and default action. In this paper, we ask whether the explanation presented for a product selection by the Alexa VA installed on an Amazon Echo device is consistent with human understanding as well as with the observations on other traditional mediums (e.g., desktop ecommerce search). Through a user survey, we find that in 81% cases the interpretation of 'a top result' by the users is different from that of Alexa. While investigating for the fairness of the default action, we observe that over a set of as many as 1000 queries, in nearly 68% cases, there exist one or more products which are more relevant (as per Amazon's own desktop search results) than the product chosen by Alexa. Finally, we conducted a survey over 30 queries for which the Alexa-selected product was different from the top desktop search result, and observed that in nearly 73% cases, the participants preferred the top desktop search result as opposed to the product chosen by Alexa.

LiteBIRD is planned to orbit the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2, where it will map the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization over the entire sky for three years, with three telescopes in 15 frequency bands between 34 and 448 GHz, to achieve an unprecedented total sensitivity of 2.2$\mu$K-arcmin, with a typical angular resolution of 0.5$^\circ$ at 100 GHz. The primary scientific objective of LiteBIRD is to search for the signal from cosmic inflation, either making a discovery or ruling out well-motivated inflationary models. The measurements of LiteBIRD will also provide us with insight into the quantum nature of gravity and other new physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology.

Exposure to trauma, violence, and substance abuse, coupled with a lack of community support services, puts homeless youth at high risk of being exploited and trafficked. Although access to safe housing and supportive services such as physical and mental healthcare is an effective response to youth s vulnerability towards being trafficked, the number of youth experiencing homelessness exceeds the capacity of available housing resources in most US communities. We undertake an informed, systematic, and data-driven approach to project the collective capacity required by service providers to adequately meet the needs of homeless youth in New York City, including those most at risk of being trafficked. Our approach involves an integer linear programming model that extends the multiple multidimensional knapsack problem and is informed by partnerships with key stakeholders. The mathematical model allows for time-dependent allocation and capacity expansion, while incorporating stochastic youth arrivals and length of stays, services provided in periodic fashion and service delivery time windows. Our RHY and service provider-centered approach is an important step toward meeting the actual, rather than presumed, survival needs of vulnerable youth, particularly those at-risk of being trafficked.

This method perturbatively expands the metric of the binary in powers of the mass ratio. The source for the perturbations depends on the orbital configuration, calculational approach, and the order of the perturbative expansion. These sources fall into three broad classes: (i) distributional, (ii) worldtube, and (iii) unbounded support. The latter, in particular, is important for emerging second-order (in the mass ratio) calculations. Traditional frequency domain approaches employ the variation of parameters method and compute the perturbation on standard time slices with numerical boundary conditions supplied at finite radius from series expansions of the asymptotic behavior. This approach has been very successful, but the boundary conditions calculations are tedious, and the approach is not well suited to unbounded sources where homogeneous solutions must be computed at all radii. This work develops an alternative approach where hyperboloidal slices foliate the spacetime, and compactifying coordinates simplify the boundary treatment. We implement this approach with a multi-domain spectral solver with analytic mesh refinement and use the scalar-field self-force on circular orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole as an example problem. The method works efficiently for all three source classes encountered in self-force calculations and has distinct advantages over the traditional approach. For example, our code efficiently computes the perturbation for orbits with extremely large orbital radii ($r_{p}>10^5M$) or modes with very high spherical harmonic mode index ($\ell \ge 100$).

The aim is to ignore unnecessary details while keeping the essential structure, thereby simplifying e.g. detection of incompatibility. One possible choice is the map based on Fisher information introduced by Huangjun Zhu, known to be an order morphism taking values in the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. We explore the properties of that construction and improve Zhu's incompatibility criterion by adding a constraint depending on the number of measurement outcomes.

We extend this work for up to $N=8$ hard sub-jets, using deep particle-flow networks (PFNs) and Transformer based networks to estimate a loose upper bound on the classification performance. The high-level jet observables perform well, with an overall classification accuracy of 86.90$\%$, but fall short of the PFN and Transformer models, which reach classification accuracies of 89.19$\%$ and 91.27$\%$ respectively, suggesting that the constituent networks utilize information not captured by the set of high-level observables.

We obtained the kinematics of the stars and ionised gas, and compared them with molecular gas kinematics from ALMA CO(2-1). We separated the ionised gas into HII regions and diffuse ionised gas (DIG) and determined the fraction of Ha luminosity originating from the DIG (f_DIG). We observe that both stars and gas trace the galactic disk rotation, as well as a fast-rotating nuclear component, likely connected to secular processes driven by the galactic bar. In the gas kinematics, we observe a stream east of the nucleus, redshifted with respect to the disk. The stream is surrounded by an extended ionised gas region with enhanced velocity dispersion and a high ionisation state, which is largely consistent with being ionised by slow shocks. We interpret this feature as either the superposition of the disk and an extraplanar layer of DIG, or as a bar-driven inflow of shocked gas. A double Gaussian component fit to the Ha line also reveals the presence of a nuclear biconic structure whose axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the bar. The two cones appear blue- and redshifted along the line of sight and stand out for having an Ha emission separated by up to 200 km s-1 from that of the disk, and a high velocity dispersion ~80-200 km s-1. At the far end of the cones, we observe that the gas is consistent with being ionised by shocks. These features had never been observed before in M83; we postulate that they are tracing a starburst-driven outflow shocking into the surrounding ISM. Finally, we obtain f_DIG ~ 13% in our field of view. We inspect the emission of the HII regions and DIG in `BPT' diagrams, finding that in HII regions photoionisation accounts for 99.8% of the Ha flux, whereas the DIG has a mixed contribution from photoionisation (94.9%) and shocks (5.1%).

To address this issue, we propose Lipschitz-constrained Skill Discovery (LSD), which encourages the agent to discover more diverse, dynamic, and far-reaching skills. Another benefit of LSD is that its learned representation function can be utilized for solving goal-following downstream tasks even in a zero-shot manner - i.e., without further training or complex planning. Through experiments on various MuJoCo robotic locomotion and manipulation environments, we demonstrate that LSD outperforms previous approaches in terms of skill diversity, state space coverage, and performance on seven downstream tasks including the challenging task of following multiple goals on Humanoid.

Indeed, this ability to continuously accrue knowledge and use past experience to learn new tasks quickly in continual settings is one of the key properties of an intelligent system. For complex and high-dimensional problems, simply updating the model continually with standard learning algorithms such as gradient descent may result in slow adaptation. Meta-learning can provide a powerful tool to accelerate adaptation yet is conventionally studied in batch settings. In this paper, we study how meta-learning can be applied to tackle online problems of this nature, simultaneously adapting to changing tasks and input distributions and meta-training the model in order to adapt more quickly in the future. Extending meta-learning into the online setting presents its own challenges, and although several prior methods have studied related problems, they generally require a discrete notion of tasks, with known ground-truth task boundaries. Such methods typically adapt to each task in sequence, resetting the model between tasks, rather than adapting continuously across tasks. In many real-world settings, such discrete boundaries are unavailable, and may not even exist. To address these settings, we propose a Fully Online Meta-Learning (FOML) algorithm, which does not require any ground truth knowledge about the task boundaries and stays fully online without resetting back to pre-trained weights.

One model is based on a heterogeneous random walk (HRW), another is an HRW with long-range jumps (the exponential model), and the other is a mean-field-like approximation of the exponential model (the deterministic model). All the models show an accumulation of the momentum at zero in the long-time limit, and a formal steady state cannot be normalized, i.e., there exists an infinite invariant density. We obtain the exact form of the infinite invariant density and the scaling function for the exponential and deterministic models and devise a useful approximation for the momentum distribution in the HRW model. While the models are kinetically non-identical, it is natural to wonder whether their ergodic properties share common traits, given that they are all described by an infinite invariant density. We show that the answer to this question depends on the type of observable under study. If the observable is integrable, the ergodic properties such as the statistical behavior of the time averages are universal as they are described by the Darling-Kac theorem. In contrast, for non-integrable observables, the models in general exhibit non-identical statistical laws. This implies that focusing on non-integrable observables, we discover non-universal features of the cooling process, that hopefully can lead to a better understanding of the particular model most suitable for a statistical description of the process.

Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL), especially contrastive learning (CL), gathers growing attention for the potential to learn molecular representations that generalize to the gigantic chemical space. Unlike supervised learning, SSL can directly leverage large unlabeled data, which greatly reduces the effort to acquire molecular property labels through costly and time-consuming simulations or experiments. However, most molecular SSL methods borrow the insights from the machine learning community but neglect the unique cheminformatics (e.g., molecular fingerprints) and multi-level graphical structures (e.g., functional groups) of molecules. In this work, we propose iMolCLR: improvement of Molecular Contrastive Learning of Representations with graph neural networks (GNNs) in two aspects, (1) mitigating faulty negative contrastive instances via considering cheminformatics similarities between molecule pairs; (2) fragment-level contrasting between intra- and inter-molecule substructures decomposed from molecules. Experiments have shown that the proposed strategies significantly improve the performance of GNN models on various challenging molecular property predictions. In comparison to the previous CL framework, iMolCLR demonstrates an averaged 1.3% improvement of ROC-AUC on 7 classification benchmarks and an averaged 4.8% decrease of the error on 5 regression benchmarks. On most benchmarks, the generic GNN pre-trained by iMolCLR rivals or even surpasses supervised learning models with sophisticated architecture designs and engineered features. Further investigations demonstrate that representations learned through iMolCLR intrinsically embed scaffolds and functional groups that can reason molecule similarities.

A well-studied and frequently used practical constraint is to allow only those packings that are guillotine separable, i.e., every rectangle in the packing can be obtained by recursively applying a sequence of edge-to-edge axis-parallel cuts (guillotine cuts) that do not intersect any item of the solution. In this paper, we study approximation algorithms for the Guillotine Strip Packing problem (GSP), i.e., the Strip Packing problem where we require additionally that the packing needs to be guillotine separable. This problem generalizes the classical Bin Packing problem and also makespan minimization on identical machines, and thus it is already strongly NP-hard. Moreover, due to a reduction from the Partition problem, it is NP-hard to obtain a polynomial-time $(3/2-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP for any $\varepsilon>0$ (exactly as Strip Packing). We provide a matching polynomial time $(3/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP. Furthermore, we present a pseudo-polynomial time $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for GSP.

We propose a systematic approach to compute optimal quantization of the retained gradients of the pointwise nonlinear functions with only a few bits per each element. We show that such approximation can be achieved by computing optimal piecewise-constant approximation of the derivative of the activation function, which can be done by dynamic programming.

However, the computer simulation of the underlying spatiotemporal models can entail a prohibitive computational cost, which constitutes a barrier to the successful development of clinically-actionable computational technologies for personalized tumor forecasting. To address this issue, here we propose to utilize Dynamic-Mode Decomposition (DMD) to construct a low-dimensional representation of cancer models and accelerate their simulation. DMD is an unsupervised machine learning method based on the singular value decomposition that has proven useful in many applications as both a predictive and a diagnostic tool. We show that DMD may be applied to Fisher-Kolmogorov models, which constitute an established formulation to represent untreated solid tumor growth that can further accommodate other relevant cancer phenomena. Our results show that a DMD implementation of this model over a clinically-relevant parameter space can yield impressive predictions, with short to medium-term errors remaining under 1% and long-term errors remaining under 20%, despite very short training periods. We posit that this data-driven approach has the potential to greatly reduce the computational overhead of personalized simulations of cancer models, thereby facilitating tumor forecasting, parameter identification, uncertainty quantification, and treatment optimization.

This has been observed in simulations of rigid objects moving through magnetised media and sloshing galaxy clusters, and then applied in interpreting observations of merger cold fronts. Using a suite of MHD simulations of binary cluster mergers, we show that even magnetic field strengths stronger than yet observed ($\beta = P_{\rm th}/P_B = 50$) show visible KHI features. This is because our initial magnetic field is tangled, producing Alfven waves and associated velocity fluctuations in the ICM; stronger initial fields therefore seed larger fluctuations, so that even a reduced growth rate due to magnetic tension produces a significant KHI. The net result is that a stronger initial magnetic field produces more dramatic fluctuations in surface brightness and temperature, not the other way around. We show that this is hard to distinguish from the evolution of turbulent perturbations of the same initial magnitude. Therefore, in order to use observations of KHI in the ICM to infer magnetic field strengths by comparing to idealized simulations, the perturbations which seed the KHI must be well-understood and (if possible) carefully controlled.

To achieve a truly scalable architecture, a coherent mid-range link between qubit registers has been suggested to solve the signal fan-out problem. Here we present a blueprint of such a $\sim 10\,\mu$m long link, called a spin qubit shuttle, which is based on connecting an array of gates into a small number of sets. The number of these gate sets and thus the number of required control signal is independent of the link distance to coherently shuttle the electron qubit. We discuss two different operation modes for the spin qubit shuttle: A qubit conveyor, i.e. a potential minimum that smoothly moves laterally, and a bucket brigade, in which the electron is transported through a series of tunnel-coupled quantum dots by adiabatic passage. We find the former approach more promising considering a realistic Si/SiGe device including potential disorder from the charged defects at the Si/SiO$_2$ layer, as well as typical charge noise. Focusing on the qubit transfer fidelity of the conveyor shuttling mode, motional narrowing, the interplay between orbital and valley excitation and relaxation in presence of $g$-factors that depend on orbital and valley state of the electron, and effects from spin-hotspots are discussed in detail. We find that a transfer fidelity of 99.9 \% is feasible in Si/SiGe at a speed of $\sim$10 m/s, if the average valley splitting and its inhomogeneity stay within realistic bounds. Operation at low global magnetic field $\approx 20$ mT and material engineering towards high valley splitting is favourable to reach high transfer fidelities.

While supervised deep learning methods have led to major breakthroughs in that direction during the past years, they usually require large amounts of annotated data to be trained, and perform poorly on other data acquired under similar experimental and imaging conditions. This is a problem known as domain adaptation, since models that learned from a sample distribution (or source domain) struggle to maintain their performance on samples extracted from a different distribution or target domain. In this work, we address the complex case of deep learning based domain adaptation for mitochondria segmentation across EM datasets from different tissues and species. We present three unsupervised domain adaptation strategies to improve mitochondria segmentation in the target domain based on (1) state-of-the-art style transfer between images of both domains; (2) self-supervised learning to pre-train a model using unlabeled source and target images, and then fine-tune it only with the source labels; and (3) multi-task neural network architectures trained end-to-end with both labeled and unlabeled images. Additionally, we propose a new training stopping criterion based on morphological priors obtained exclusively in the source domain. We carried out all possible cross-dataset experiments using three publicly available EM datasets. We evaluated our proposed strategies on the mitochondria semantic labels predicted on the target datasets. The methods introduced here outperform the baseline methods and compare favorably to the state of the art. In the absence of validation labels, monitoring our proposed morphology-based metric is an intuitive and effective way to stop the training process and select in average optimal models.

The EDE contributes a maximum fractional energy density of $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)=0.163^{+0.047}_{-0.04}$ at a redshift $z_c=3357\pm200$ and leads to a CMB inferred value of the Hubble constant $H_0=74.2^{+1.9}_{-2.1}$ km/s/Mpc.

A key challenge for this task lies in the large amount of types and the scarcity of annotated data per type. Existing systems formulate the task as a multi-way classification problem and train directly or distantly supervised classifiers. This causes two issues: (i) the classifiers do not capture the type semantics since types are often converted into indices; (ii) systems developed in this way are limited to predicting within a pre-defined type set, and often fall short of generalizing to types that are rarely seen or unseen in training. This work presents LITE, a new approach that formulates entity typing as a natural language inference (NLI) problem, making use of (i) the indirect supervision from NLI to infer type information meaningfully represented as textual hypotheses and alleviate the data scarcity issue, as well as (ii) a learning-to-rank objective to avoid the pre-defining of a type set. Experiments show that, with limited training data, LITE obtains state-of-the-art performance on the UFET task.

Using observations by PHANGS-ALMA/SDSS and simulations by GRIFFIN/IllustrisTNG we explore the evolution of this H$_2$ column density distribution function [$f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$]. The H$_2$ (and HI) column density maps for TNG50 and TNG100 are derived in post-processing and are made available through the IllustrisTNG online API. The shape and normalization of $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ of individual main-sequence star-forming galaxies are correlated with the star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (${M_*}$), and H$_2$ mass ($M_{\rm{H}_2}$) in both observations and simulations. TNG100, combined with H$_2$ post-processing models, broadly reproduces observations, albeit with differences in slope and normalization. Also, an analytically modelled $f(N)$, based on exponential gas disks, matches well with the simulations. The GRIFFIN simulation gives first indications that the slope of $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ might not majorly differ when including non-equilibrium chemistry in simulations. The $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ by TNG100 implies that higher molecular gas column densities are reached at $z=3$ than at $z=0$. Further, denser regions contribute more to the molecular mass density at $z=3$. Finally, H$_2$ starts dominating compared to HI only at column densities above log($N_{\rm{H}_2} / \rm{cm}^{-2}) \sim 21.8-22$ at both redshifts. These results imply that neutral atomic gas is an important contributor to the overall cold gas mass found in the ISM of galaxies including at densities typical for molecular clouds at $z=0$ and $z=3$.

These magnetic fields are due to a dynamo action, which is a process of converting turbulent kinetic energy to magnetic energy. A dynamo that acts at scales less than the turbulent driving scale is known as the turbulent dynamo. The ISM is a multiphase medium and observations suggests that the properties of magnetic fields differ with the phase. Here, we aim to study how the properties of the turbulent dynamo depend on the phase. We simulate the non-isothermal turbulent dynamo in a two-phase medium (most previous work assumes an isothermal gas). We find that the growth rate of magnetic fields in the exponentially growing stage is similar in both the phases, and this is because of a roughly equal amount of vorticity being generated in each phase. We further compute each term responsible for amplification and destruction of vorticity and show that the amplification of vorticity by turbulent motions is a dominant term (similar in both the phases) followed by the baroclinic term (only present in non-isothermal gases, higher in the warm phase) and the term for viscous interactions in the presence of logarithmic density gradients (higher in the cold phase). We find that the final ratio of magnetic to turbulent kinetic energy is lower due to a stronger Lorentz force.

Here we formalize the problem of creating equitable training datasets, and propose a statistical framework for addressing this problem. We consider a setting where a model builder must decide how to allocate a fixed data collection budget to gather training data from different subgroups. We then frame dataset creation as a constrained optimization problem, in which one maximizes a function of group-specific performance metrics based on (estimated) group-specific learning rates and costs per sample. This flexible approach incorporates preferences of model-builders and other stakeholders, as well as the statistical properties of the learning task. When data collection decisions are made sequentially, we show that under certain conditions this optimization problem can be efficiently solved even without prior knowledge of the learning rates. To illustrate our approach, we conduct a simulation study of polygenic risk scores on synthetic genomic data -- an application domain that often suffers from non-representative data collection. We find that our adaptive sampling strategy outperforms several common data collection heuristics, including equal and proportional sampling, demonstrating the value of strategic dataset design for building equitable models.

They can then use encoding models to find out which brain ""zone"" (e.g. which region of interest, volume pixel or electrophysiology sensor) is predicted from the stimulus properties. Given the assumptions underlying this setup, when stimulus properties are predictive of the activity in a zone, these properties are understood to cause activity in that zone. In recent years, researchers have used neural networks to construct representations that capture the diverse properties of complex stimuli, such as natural language or natural images. Encoding models built using these high-dimensional representations are often able to significantly predict the activity in large swathes of cortex, suggesting that the activity in all these brain zones is caused by stimulus properties captured in the representation. It is then natural to ask: ""Is the activity in these different brain zones caused by the stimulus properties in the same way?"" In neuroscientific terms, this corresponds to asking if these different zones process the stimulus properties in the same way. Here, we propose a new framework that enables researchers to ask if the properties of a stimulus affect two brain zones in the same way. We use simulated data and two real fMRI datasets with complex naturalistic stimuli to show that our framework enables us to make such inferences. Our inferences are strikingly consistent between the two datasets, indicating that the proposed framework is a promising new tool for neuroscientists to understand how information is processed in the brain.

Two methods for finding flat minima stand out: 1. Averaging methods (i.e., Stochastic Weight Averaging, SWA), and 2. Minimax methods (i.e., Sharpness Aware Minimization, SAM). However, despite similar motivations, there has been limited investigation into their properties and no comprehensive comparison between them. In this work, we investigate the loss surfaces from a systematic benchmarking of these approaches across computer vision, natural language processing, and graph learning tasks. The results lead to a simple hypothesis: since both approaches find different flat solutions, combining them should improve generalization even further. We verify this improves over either flat-minima approach in 39 out of 42 cases. When it does not, we investigate potential reasons. We hope our results across image, graph, and text data will help researchers to improve deep learning optimizers, and practitioners to pinpoint the optimizer for the problem at hand.

These entities' deep neural network (DNN) models are often trained on proprietary data. They require powerful computational resources, with the resulting DNN models being incorporated in the company's work pipeline or provided as a service. Being trained on proprietary information, these models provide a competitive edge for the owner company. At the same time, these models can be attractive to competitors (or malicious entities), which can employ state-of-the-art security attacks to obtain and use these models for their benefit. As these attacks are hard to prevent, it becomes imperative to have mechanisms that enable an affected entity to verify the ownership of its DNN with high confidence. This paper presents TATTOOED, a robust and efficient DNN watermarking technique based on spread-spectrum channel coding. TATTOOED has a negligible effect on the performance of the DNN model and is robust against several state-of-the-art mechanisms used to remove watermarks from DNNs. Our results show that TATTOOED is robust to such removal techniques even in extreme scenarios. For example, if the removal techniques such as fine-tuning and parameter pruning change as much as 99% of the model parameters, the TATTOOED watermark is still present in full in the DNN model and ensures ownership verification.
