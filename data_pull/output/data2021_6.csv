The specific application is a set of 2008 and 2015 replications of an intervention aiming to increase primary education for girls in rural Afghanistan. The intervention offers a new schooling option, and as such, its effects depend on how individuals use alternatives that already exist. The principal strata approach accounts variation in use patterns when comparing effects across the replications. Our findings show that even though the share of girls for whom the intervention would be valuable dropped considerably in 2015 as compared to 2008, the intervention was even more efficaciousness for those who continued to benefit from it.

In this paper, we propose a regularization scheme for DEQ models that explicitly regularizes the Jacobian of the fixed-point update equations to stabilize the learning of equilibrium models. We show that this regularization adds only minimal computational cost, significantly stabilizes the fixed-point convergence in both forward and backward passes, and scales well to high-dimensional, realistic domains (e.g., WikiText-103 language modeling and ImageNet classification). Using this method, we demonstrate, for the first time, an implicit-depth model that runs with approximately the same speed and level of performance as popular conventional deep networks such as ResNet-101, while still maintaining the constant memory footprint and architectural simplicity of DEQs.

We assume that the potential cluster centers belong to a set of groups defined by protected attributes, such as ethnicity, gender, etc. We then ask to find a minimum-cost clustering of the data into $k$ clusters so that a specified minimum number of cluster centers are chosen from each group. We thus require that all groups are represented in the clustering solution as cluster centers, according to specified requirements. More precisely, we are given a set of clients $C$, a set of facilities $\pazocal{F}$, a collection $\mathcal{F}=\{F_1,\dots,F_t\}$ of facility groups $F_i \subseteq \pazocal{F}$, budget $k$, and a set of lower-bound thresholds $R=\{r_1,\dots,r_t\}$, one for each group in $\mathcal{F}$.

We show that in the general case where the facility groups may overlap, the diversity-aware $k$-median problem is \np-hard, fixed-parameter intractable, and inapproximable to any multiplicative factor. On the other hand, when the facility groups are disjoint, approximation algorithms can be obtained by reduction to the \emph{matroid median} and \emph{red-blue median} problems.

To this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST) that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network. We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE, multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality.

Manifolds are discovered using the convergent cross mapping (CCM) causal inference algorithm which are then compressed into a reduced redundancy network. The representation is a network of manifolds embedded from observational data where each orthogonal axis of a local manifold is an embedding of a individually identifiable neuron or brain area that has exact correspondence in the real world. As such these can be experimentally manipulated to test hypotheses derived from theory and data analysis. Here we demonstrate that this representation preserves the essential features of the brain of flies,larval zebrafish and humans. In addition to accurate near-term prediction, the GMN model can be used to synthesize realistic time series of whole brain neuronal activity and locomotion viewed over the long term. Thus, as a final validation of how well GMN captures essential dynamic information, we show that the artificially generated time series can be used as a training set to predict out-of-sample observed fly locomotion, as well as brain activity in out of sample withheld data not used in model building. Remarkably, the artificially generated time series show realistic novel behaviors that do not exist in the training data, but that do exist in the out-of-sample observational data. This suggests that GMN captures inherently emergent properties of the network. We suggest our approach may be a generic recipe for mapping time series observations of any complex nonlinear network into a model that is able to generate naturalistic system behaviors that identifies variables that have real world correspondence and can be experimentally manipulated.

We investigate the extent to which this universality continues to hold beyond the Euclidean setting, taking as case studies Bernoulli bond percolation and lattice trees. We present strong numerical evidence that the critical exponents governing these models on transitive graphs of polynomial volume growth depend only on the volume-growth dimension of the graph and not on any other large-scale features of the geometry. For example, our results strongly suggest that percolation, which has upper-critical dimension six, has the same critical exponents on the four-dimensional hypercubic lattice $\mathbb{Z}^4$ and the Heisenberg group despite the distinct large-scale geometries of these two lattices preventing the relevant percolation models from sharing a common scaling limit. On the other hand, we also show that no such universality should be expected to hold on fractals, even if one allows the exponents to depend on a large number of standard fractal dimensions. Indeed, we give natural examples of two fractals which share Hausdorff, spectral, topological, and topological Hausdorff dimensions but exhibit distinct numerical values of the percolation Fisher exponent $\tau$.

We then provide a comprehensive comparison of three approaches of modeling non-linearities, while including the effects of this dark sector coupling. We base our modeling of non-linearities on the two most popular perturbation theory approaches: TNS and EFTofLSS. To test the validity and precision of the modelling, we perform an MCMC analysis using simulated data corresponding to a $\Lambda$CDM fiducial cosmology and Stage-IV surveys specifications in two redshift bins, $z=0.5$ and $z=1$. We find the most complex EFTofLSS-based model studied to be better suited at both, describing the mock data up to smaller scales, and extracting the most information. Using this model, we forecast uncertainties on the dark energy equation of state, $w$, and on the interaction parameter, $A$, finding $\sigma_w=0.06$ and $\sigma_A=1.1$ b/GeV for the analysis at $z=0.5$ and $\sigma_w=0.06$ and $\sigma_A=2.0$ b/GeV for the analysis at $z=1$.

In this work, we try to close the performance gap and demonstrate that attention-based models are indeed able to outperform CNNs.

Unlike self-attention that focuses on global dependency modeling at a coarse level, the outlook attention efficiently encodes finer-level features and contexts into tokens, which is shown to be critically beneficial to recognition performance but largely ignored by the self-attention. Experiments show that our VOLO achieves 87.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, which is the first model exceeding 87% accuracy on this competitive benchmark, without using any extra training data In addition, the pre-trained VOLO transfers well to downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation.

We report our results on spectral characterization of Nereid using its reflectance spectrum from 0.8-2.4 $\mu m$, providing the first measurements over the range of 0.8-1.4 $\mu m$. We detect spectral absorption features of crystalline water ice in close agreement with previous measurements. We show that model fits of simple intimate mixtures including water ice do not provide simultaneous matches to absorption band depths at 1.5 and 2.0 $\mu m$ when accounting for the spectral continuum. Possible solutions include invoking a more complex continuum, including both crystalline and amorphous water ice, and allowing for sub-micron sized grains. We show that mixtures including magnetite and the CM2 chondrite Murchison provide a flexible framework for interpreting spectral variation of bodies with neutral-sloped spectra like that of Nereid. Magnetite in particular provides a good match to the spectral continuum without requiring the presence of Tholin-like organics. We note that carbonaceous chondrites and their components may be useful analogs for the non-ice components of outer solar system bodies, consistent with recent findings by Fraser et al. (2019). Comparison to spectra of large TNOs and satellites of Uranus show that Nereid's low albedo, deep water bands, and neutral color is distinct from many other icy objects, but such comparisons are limited by incomplete understanding of spectral variability among $\sim$100km-sized icy bodies.

What aspects of a visual task does attention help to deal with? We aim to answer this with a computational experiment based on a general framework called task-oriented ablation design. First we define a broad range of visual tasks and identify six factors that underlie task variability. Then on each task we compare the performance of two neural networks, one with top-down attention and one without. These comparisons reveal the task-dependence of attention's perceptual boost, giving a clearer idea of the role attention plays.

However, the complexity of the standard represents an obstacle for its adoption in the ML community and creates a need for software libraries and tools that simplify working with data sets in DICOM format.

Simultaneously, by simplifying creation and parsing of DICOM-compliant files, highdicom achieves interoperability with the medical imaging systems that hold the data used to train and run ML models, and ultimately communicate and store model outputs for clinical use. We demonstrate through experiments with slide microscopy and computed tomography imaging, that, by bridging these two ecosystems, highdicom enables developers to train and evaluate state-of-the-art ML models in pathology and radiology while remaining compliant with the DICOM standard and interoperable with clinical systems at all stages.

In this study, we explore the relationship between face-area-lightness-measures (FALMs) estimated from images and ground-truth skin readings collected using a device designed to measure human skin. FALMs estimated from different images of the same individual varied significantly relative to ground-truth FALM. This variation was only reduced by greater control of acquisition (camera, background, and environment). Next, we compare ground-truth FALM to Fitzpatrick Skin Types (FST) categories obtained using the standard, in-person, medical survey and show FST is poorly predictive of skin-tone. Finally, we show how noisy estimation of FALM leads to errors selecting explanatory factors for demographic differentials. These results demonstrate that measures of skin-tone for biometric performance evaluations must come from objective, characterized, and controlled sources.

After all the participating code groups successfully completed the calibration steps, we reach a suite of cosmological simulations with similar mass assembly histories down to $z=4$. With numerical accuracy that resolves the internal structure of a target halo, we find that the codes overall agree well with one another in e.g., gas and stellar properties, but also show differences in e.g., circumgalactic medium properties. We argue that, if adequately tested in accordance with our proposed calibration steps and common parameters, the results of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations can be robust and reproducible.

In this paper, we show that improved correspondences can be learned automatically as a natural byproduct of learning category-specific dense pose predictors. To do this, we express correspondences between different categories and between images and categories using a unified embedding. Then, we use the latter to enforce two constraints: symmetric inter-category cycle consistency and a new asymmetric image-to-category cycle consistency. Without any manual annotations for the inter-category correspondences, we obtain state-of-the-art alignment results, outperforming dedicated methods for matching 3D shapes.

Despite its successes, the quantum field theoretic origins and the range of validity for this equation have remained elusive, and establishing a formalism to systematically incorporate higher order effects has been an area of active study. In this paper, we calculate the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) corrections to Stochastic Inflation using Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). In this effective description, Stochastic Inflation manifests as the renormalization group evolution of composite operators. The leading impact of non-Gaussian quantum fluctuations appears at NNLO, which is presented here for the first time; we derive the coefficient of this term from a two-loop anomalous dimension calculation within SdSET.

In the process, we must match the UV theory onto SdSET at one-loop order, which provides a non-trivial confirmation that the separation into Wilson-coefficient corrections and contributions to initial conditions persists beyond tree level.

With that setting, the empirical risk minimization training procedure often does not perform well, since it does not account for the change in the distribution. A common approach in the domain adaptation literature is to learn a representation of the input that has the same (marginal) distribution over the source and the target domain. However, these approaches often require additional networks and/or optimizing an adversarial (minimax) objective, which can be very expensive or unstable in practice. To improve upon these marginal alignment techniques, in this paper, we first derive a generalization bound for the target loss based on the training loss and the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source and the target representation distributions. Based on this bound, we derive an algorithm that minimizes the KL term to obtain a better generalization to the target domain. We show that with a probabilistic representation network, the KL term can be estimated efficiently via minibatch samples without any additional network or a minimax objective.

Key advantages of DDPMs include ease of training, in contrast to generative adversarial networks, and speed of generation, in contrast to autoregressive models. However, DDPMs typically require hundreds-to-thousands of steps to generate a high fidelity sample, making them prohibitively expensive for high dimensional problems. Fortunately, DDPMs allow trading generation speed for sample quality through adjusting the number of refinement steps as a post process. Prior work has been successful in improving generation speed through handcrafting the time schedule by trial and error. We instead view the selection of the inference time schedules as an optimization problem, and introduce an exact dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal discrete time schedules for any pre-trained DDPM. Our method exploits the fact that ELBO can be decomposed into separate KL terms, and given any computation budget, discovers the time schedule that maximizes the training ELBO exactly.

Modern trends in machine learning research have led to algorithms that are increasingly intricate to the degree that they are considered to be black boxes. In an effort to reduce the opacity of decisions, methods have been proposed to construe the inner workings of such models in a human-comprehensible manner. These post hoc techniques are described as being universal explainers - capable of faithfully augmenting decisions with algorithmic insight. Unfortunately, there is little agreement about what constitutes a ""good"" explanation. Moreover, current methods of explanation evaluation are derived from either subjective or proxy means. In this work, we propose a framework for the evaluation of post hoc explainers on ground truth that is directly derived from the additive structure of a model. We demonstrate the efficacy of the framework in understanding explainers by evaluating popular explainers on thousands of synthetic and several real-world tasks. The framework unveils that explanations may be accurate but misattribute the importance of individual features. ",A Framework for Evaluating Post Hoc Feature-Additive Explainers

This motion accounts for the known motion of the Solar System barycentre with a best-fit amplitude of $369$ km/s, in the direction ($\ell= 264^\circ$, $b=48^\circ$) in galactic coordinates. Along with the CMB dipole signal, this motion also causes an inevitable signature of statistical anisotropy in the higher multipoles due to the modulation and aberration of the CMB temperature and polarization fields. This leads to a correlation between adjacent CMB multipoles causing a non-zero value of the off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix which can be captured in terms of the dipolar spectra of the bipolar spherical harmonics (BipoSH). In our work, we jointly infer the CMB power spectrum and the BipoSH spectrum in a Bayesian framework using the $\textit{Planck}$-2018 $\texttt{SMICA}$ temperature map. We detect amplitude and direction of the local motion consistent with the canonical value $v=369$ km/s inferred from CMB dipole with a statistical significance of $4.54\sigma$, $4.97\sigma$ and $5.23\sigma$ respectively from the masked temperature map with the available sky fraction $40.1\%$, $59.1\%$, and $72.2\%$, confirming the common origin of both the signals. The Bayes factor in favor of the canonical value is between $7$ to $8$ depending on the choice of mask. But it strongly disagrees (by a value of the Bayes factor about $10^{-10}-10^{-11}$) with a higher value of local motion which one can infer from the amplitude of the dipole signal obtained from the CatWISE2020 quasar catalog using the WISE and NEOWISE data set.

One cannot model those objects' population properties or incidences without a quantitative understanding of the conditions under which these objects ended up in a catalog or sample, the sample's selection function. As systematic and didactic introductions to this topic are scarce in the astrophysical literature, we aim to provide one, addressing generically the following questions: What is a selection function? What arguments $\vec{q}$ should a selection function depend on? Over what domain must a selection function be defined? What approximations and simplifications can be made? And, how is a selection function used in `modelling'? We argue that volume-complete samples, with the volume drastically curtailed by the faintest objects, reflect a highly sub-optimal selection function that needlessly reduces the number of bright and usually rare objects in the sample. We illustrate these points by a worked example, deriving the space density of white dwarfs (WD) in the Galactic neighbourhood as a function of their luminosity and Gaia color, $\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$ in [mag$^{-2}$pc$^{-3}$]. We construct a sample of $10^5$ presumed WDs through straightforward selection cuts on the Gaia EDR3 catalog, in magnitude, color, parallax, and astrometric fidelity $\vec{q}=(m_G,B-R,\varpi,p_{af})$. We then combine a simple model for $\Phi_0$ with the effective survey volume derived from this selection function $S_C(\vec{q})$ to derive a detailed and robust estimate of $\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$. This resulting white dwarf luminosity-color function $\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$ differs dramatically from the initial number density distribution in the luminosity-color plane: by orders of magnitude in density and by four magnitudes in density peak location.

In this region, observations have shown several periodic convective plumes, likely from latent heat release from water condensation, which affect the cloud and zonal wind structure of the jet. We model this region with the Explicit Planetary hybrid-Isentropic Coordinate model using its active microphysics scheme to study the phenomenology of water and ammonia clouds within the jet region. On perturbing the atmosphere, we find that an upper tropospheric wave develops that directly influences the cloud structure within the jet. This wave travels at $\sim75$ m/s in our model, and leads to periodic chevron-shaped features in the ammonia cloud deck. These features travel with the wave speed, and are subsequently much slower than the zonal wind at the cloud deck. The cloud structure, and the slower drift rate, were both observed following the convective outbreak in this region in 2016 and 2020. We find that an upper level circulation is responsible for these cloud features in the aftermath of the convective outbursts. The comparatively slower observed drift rates of these features, relative to the wind speed of the jet, provides constraints on the vertical wind shear above the cloud tops, and we suggest that wind velocities determined from cloud tracking should correspond to a different altitude compared to the $680$ hPa pressure level. We also diagnose the convective potential of the atmosphere due to water condensation, and find that it is strongly coupled to the wave.

HuBERT relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised clustering step rather than the intrinsic quality of the assigned cluster labels.

While photometric lensing and clustering cross-correlations have provided some of the tightest cosmological constraints to date, it is not well understood how to optimally perform similar RSD/WL joint analyses in a lossless way. RSD is typically measured in $3D$ redshift space, but WL is inherently a projected signal, making angular statistics a natural choice for the combined analysis. Thus, we determine the amount of RSD information that can be extracted using projected statistics. Specifically we perform a Fisher analysis to forecast constraints and model bias comparing two different Fingers-of-God (FoG) models using both, the $3D$ power spectrum, $P(k, \mu)$, and tomographic $C(\ell)$. We find that because na\""ive tomographic projection mixes large scales with poorly modelled nonlinear radial modes, it does not provide competitive constraints to the $3D$ RSD power spectrum without the model bias becoming unacceptably large. This is true even in the limit of narrow tomographic bins. In light of this we propose a new radial weighting scheme which unmixes radial RSD scales in projection yielding competitive constraints to the $3D$ RSD power spectrum, while keeping the model bias small. This work lays the groundwork for optimal joint analyses of RSD and cosmic shear. ",The RSD Sorting Hat: Unmixing Radial Scales in Projection

Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large-Scale Challenge. Our key insight to utilizing Transformer in the graph is the necessity of effectively encoding the structural information of a graph into the model. To this end, we propose several simple yet effective structural encoding methods to help Graphormer better model graph-structured data. Besides, we mathematically characterize the expressive power of Graphormer and exhibit that with our ways of encoding the structural information of graphs, many popular GNN variants could be covered as the special cases of Graphormer.

To this end, we introduce a method to estimate arbitrary, non-parametric distributions on SO(3). Our key idea is to represent the distributions implicitly, with a neural network that estimates the probability given the input image and a candidate pose. Grid sampling or gradient ascent can be used to find the most likely pose, but it is also possible to evaluate the probability at any pose, enabling reasoning about symmetries and uncertainty. This is the most general way of representing distributions on manifolds, and to showcase the rich expressive power, we introduce a dataset of challenging symmetric and nearly-symmetric objects. We require no supervision on pose uncertainty -- the model trains only with a single pose per example. Nonetheless, our implicit model is highly expressive to handle complex distributions over 3D poses, while still obtaining accurate pose estimation on standard non-ambiguous environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance on Pascal3D+ and ModelNet10-SO(3) benchmarks.

The LR is a valid measure of probative value because, by Bayes Theorem, the higher the LR is, the more our belief in the probability the hypothesis is true increases after observing the evidence. The LR is popular because it measures the probative value of evidence without having to make any explicit assumptions about the prior probability of the hypothesis.

We attribute this to much weaker domain-wall binding in the antiferromagnetic case. For quenches across the quantum critical point, \textit{regular} cusps appear in the return rate and connect to the local order parameter changing sign, indicating the concurrence of two major concepts of dynamical phase transitions. Our results consolidate conclusions of previous works that a necessary condition for the appearance of anomalous cusps in the return rate after quenches within the ordered phase is for topologically trivial local spin flips to be the energetically dominant excitations in the spectrum of the quench Hamiltonian.

In this article, we introduce perturbative quantum simulation, which combines the complementary strengths of the two approaches, enabling the solution of large practical quantum problems using noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. The use of a quantum processor eliminates the need to identify a solvable unperturbed Hamiltonian, while the introduction of perturbative coupling permits the quantum processor to simulate systems larger than the available number of physical qubits.

In rapidly rotating neutron stars, it has been shown that the lower gravity at the equator can lead to preferential ignition of X-ray bursts at this location. These models, however, do not include the effect of accretion hotspots at the neutron star surface. There are two accreting neutron star sources in which burst oscillations have been observed to track exactly the neutron star spin period. We analyse whether this could be due to the X-ray bursts igniting at the magnetic pole of the neutron star, because of heating in the accreted layers under the hotspot causing ignition conditions to be reached earlier. We investigate heat transport in the accreted layers using a 2D model and study the prevalence of heating down to the ignition depth of X-ray bursts for different hotspot temperatures and sizes.

This paper proposes a multi-task training framework to make the SE models unharmful to ASR. Because most ASR training samples do not have corresponding clean signal references, we alternately perform two model update steps called SE-step and ASR-step. The SE-step uses clean and noisy signal pairs and a signal-based loss function. The ASR-step applies a pre-trained ASR model to training signals enhanced with the SE model. A cross-entropy loss between the ASR output and reference transcriptions is calculated to update the SE model parameters. Experimental results with realistic large-scale settings using ASR models trained on 75,000-hour data show that the proposed framework improves the word error rate for the SE output by 11.82% with little compromise in the SE quality. Performance analysis is also carried out by changing the ASR model, the data used for the ASR-step, and the schedule of the two update steps.

This approach has appealing properties, but remains a largely theoretical idea applicable to a limited set of tabular RL tasks. Moreover, it is unclear how to extend HCA to deep RL environments. In this work, we explore the use of HCA-style credit in a deep RL context. We first describe the limitations of existing HCA algorithms in deep RL that lead to their poor performance or complete lack of training, then propose several theoretically-justified modifications to overcome them. We explore the quantitative and qualitative effects of the resulting algorithm on the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) benchmark, and observe that it improves performance over Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) on many games where non-trivial credit assignment is necessary to achieve high scores and where hindsight probabilities can be accurately estimated.

Whereas standard return maximization tends to converge to a single return-maximizing sequence, there are cases where we would like to sample a diverse set of high-return solutions. These arise, for example, in black-box function optimization when few rounds are possible, each with large batches of queries, where the batches should be diverse, e.g., in the design of new molecules. One can also see this as a problem of approximately converting an energy function to a generative distribution. While MCMC methods can achieve that, they are expensive and generally only perform local exploration. Instead, training a generative policy amortizes the cost of search during training and yields to fast generation. Using insights from Temporal Difference learning, we propose GFlowNet, based on a view of the generative process as a flow network, making it possible to handle the tricky case where different trajectories can yield the same final state, e.g., there are many ways to sequentially add atoms to generate some molecular graph. We cast the set of trajectories as a flow and convert the flow consistency equations into a learning objective, akin to the casting of the Bellman equations into Temporal Difference methods. We prove that any global minimum of the proposed objectives yields a policy which samples from the desired distribution, and demonstrate the improved performance and diversity of GFlowNet on a simple domain where there are many modes to the reward function, and on a molecule synthesis task.

Intuitively, pairs of events that are always observed in the same order are likely to be separated by an irreversible sequence of actions. Conveniently, learning the temporal order of events can be done in a fully self-supervised way, which we use to estimate the reversibility of actions from experience, without any priors. We propose two different strategies that incorporate reversibility in RL agents, one strategy for exploration (RAE) and one strategy for control (RAC).

To address the high communication costs of distributed training, which is further exacerbated by the fact that modern highly performing models are typically overparameterized, a large body of work has been devoted in recent years to the design of various compression strategies, such as sparsification and quantization, and optimization algorithms capable of using them. Recently, Safaryan et al (2021) pioneered a dramatically different compression design approach: they first use the local training data to form local {\em smoothness matrices}, and then propose to design a compressor capable of exploiting the smoothness information contained therein. While this novel approach leads to substantial savings in communication, it is limited to sparsification as it crucially depends on the linearity of the compression operator. In this work, we resolve this problem by extending their smoothness-aware compression strategy to arbitrary unbiased compression operators, which also includes sparsification. Specializing our results to quantization, we observe significant savings in communication complexity compared to standard quantization. In particular, we show theoretically that block quantization with $n$ blocks outperforms single block quantization, leading to a reduction in communication complexity by an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ factor, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the distributed system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical evidence that our smoothness-aware quantization strategies outperform existing quantization schemes as well the aforementioned smoothness-aware sparsification strategies with respect to all relevant success measures: the number of iterations, the total amount of bits communicated, and wall-clock time.

A promising candidate is a class of hybrid circuits, where entangling unitary dynamics compete with disentangling measurements. Novel phase transitions between different entanglement regimes have been identified in their dynamical states, with universal properties hinting at unexplored critical phenomena. Trapped ion hardware is a leading contender for the experimental realization of such physics, which requires not only traditional two-qubit entangling gates, but a constant rate of local measurements accurately addressed throughout the circuit. Recent progress in engineering high-precision optical addressing of individual ions makes preparing a constant rate of measurements throughout a unitary circuit feasible. Using tensor network simulations, we show that the resulting class of hybrid circuits, prepared with native gates, exhibits a volume-law to area-law transition in the entanglement entropy. This displays universal hallmarks of a measurement-induced phase transition. Our simulations are able to characterize the critical exponents using circuit sizes with tens of qubits and thousands of gates. We argue that this transition should be robust against additional sources of experimental noise expected in modern trapped ion hardware, and will rather be limited by statistical requirements on post selection.

As such, it is not beneficial to provide high SNR signals during training, and fastest convergence is achieved when low SNR samples are provided early on. During testing we found that the networks are sometimes unable to recover any signals when a false alarm probability $<10^{-3}$ is required.

Concretely, we ground this question in the sandbox of probabilistic context-free-grammars (PCFGs), and identify a key aspect of the representational power of these approaches: the amount and directionality of context that the predictor has access to when forced to make parsing decision. We show that with limited context (either bounded, or unidirectional), there are PCFGs, for which these approaches cannot represent the max-likelihood parse; conversely, if the context is unlimited, they can represent the max-likelihood parse of any PCFG.

However, due to the increasing system complexity and the fundamental hardness of designing a controller with formal guarantees, such an open-loop process of design-then-verify often results in many iterations and fails to provide the necessary guarantees. In this paper, we propose a correct-by-construction control learning framework that integrates the verification into the control design process in a closed-loop manner, i.e., design-while-verify. Specifically, we leverage the verification results (computed reachable set of the system state) to construct feedback metrics for control learning, which measure how likely the current design of control parameters can meet the required reach-avoid property for safety and goal-reaching. We formulate an optimization problem based on such metrics for tuning the controller parameters, and develop an approximated gradient descent algorithm with a difference method to solve the optimization problem and learn the controller. The learned controller is formally guaranteed to meet the required reach-avoid property. By treating verifiability as a first-class objective and effectively leveraging the verification results during the control learning process, our approach can significantly improve the chance of finding a control design with formal property guarantees. This is demonstrated via a set of experiments on both linear and non-linear systems that use model-based or neural network based controllers.

Dynamical and turbulent motions of gas in a protoplanetary disk are crucial for their evolution and affect planet formation. Recent observations suggest weak turbulence in the disk's outer regions. However, the physical mechanism of turbulence in these outer regions remains uncertain. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to produce turbulence in disks. Aims. Our aim is to study the observability of the gas velocity structure produced by the VSI via CO kinematics with ALMA. Methods. We perform global 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a VSI-unstable disk. We post-process the simulation results with radiative transfer calculations, and produce synthetic predictions of CO rotational emission lines. Following, we compute the line of sight velocity map, and its deviations from a sub-Keplerian equilibrium solution. We explore the detectability of the VSI by identifying kinematic signatures using realistic simulated observations. Results. Our 3D simulations of the VSI show the steady state dynamics of the gas in great detail. From the velocity structure we infer a turbulent stress value of $\alpha_{r\phi}=1.4 \times 10^{-4}$. On large scales, we observe velocity deviations of 50 m s$^{-1}$ as axisymmetric rings. We find optimal conditions at $i \lesssim 20^{\circ}$ to trace for the kinematic structures of the VSI. We found that current diagnostics to constrain gas turbulence from non-thermal broadening of the line emission are not applicable to anisotropic VSI turbulence. Conclusions. The detection of kinematic signatures produced by the VSI is possible with ALMA. Observations including an extended antenna configuration combined with the highest spectral resolution available are needed for robust detection. The characterization of the large-scale velocity perturbations is required to constrain the turbulence level produced by the VSI from gas observations.

These limitations suggest that tech ethics enables corporate ""ethics-washing"": embracing the language of ethics to defuse criticism and resist government regulation, without committing to ethical behavior. Given these dynamics, I describe tech ethics as a terrain of contestation where the central debate is not whether ethics is desirable, but what ""ethics"" entails and who gets to define it.

High frequency measurements produce big data sets that present opportunities to conduct new analyses for improved understanding of water quality dynamics and more effective management of rivers and streams. Of primary importance is enhancing knowledge of the relationships between nitrate, one of the most reactive forms of inorganic nitrogen in the aquatic environment, and other water quality variables. We analysed high frequency water quality data from in situ sensors deployed in three sites from different watersheds and climate zones within the National Ecological Observatory Network, USA. We used generalised additive mixed models to explain the nonlinear relationships at each site between nitrate concentration and conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and elevation. Temporal auto correlation was modelled with an auto regressive moving average model and we examined the relative importance of the explanatory variables. Total deviance explained by the models was high for all sites. Although variable importance and the smooth regression parameters differed among sites, the models explaining the most variation in nitrate contained the same explanatory variables. This study demonstrates that building a model for nitrate using the same set of explanatory water quality variables is achievable, even for sites with vastly different environmental and climatic characteristics. Applying such models will assist managers to select cost effective water quality variables to monitor when the goals are to gain a spatially and temporally in depth understanding of nitrate dynamics and adapt management plans accordingly.

Straightforward ways to quantify the difference between two systems and more generally, two sets of multiplanetary systems, are useful tools in the study of this diversity. In this work we present a novel approach, using a Weighted extension of the Energy Distance (WED) metric, to quantify the difference between planetary systems on the logarithmic period-radius plane. We demonstrate the use of this metric and its relation to previously introduced descriptive measures to characterise the arrangements of Kepler planetary systems. By applying exploratory machine learning tools, we attempt to find whether there is some order that can be ascribed to the set of Kepler multiplanet system architectures. Based on WED, the 'Sequencer', which is such an automatic tool, identifies a progression from small and compact planetary systems to systems with distant giant planets. It is reassuring to see that a WED-based tool indeed identifies this progression. Next, we extend WED to define the Inter-Catalogue Energy Distance (ICED) - a distance metric between sets of multiplanetary systems. We have made the specific implementation presented in the paper available to the community through a public repository. We suggest to use these metrics as complementary tools in attempting to compare between architectures of planetary system, and in general, catalogues of planetary systems.

Historically the ""Lithium test"", a search for the presence and strength of the Li line at 670.8 nm, has been a marker if an object has a substellar mass with stellar-like spectral energy distribution (e.g., a late-type M dwarf). While the Li test could in principle also be used to distinguish masses of later-type L-T dwarfs, Li is predominantly no longer found as an atomic gas, but rather a molecular species such as LiH, LiF, LiOH, and LiCl in their cooler atmospheres. L- and T-type brown dwarfs are also quite faint at 670 nm and thus challenging targets for high resolution spectroscopy. But only recently have experimental molecular line lists become available for the molecular Li species, allowing molecular Li mass discrimination. In this study, we generated the latest opacity of each of these Li-bearing molecules and performed thermochemical equilibrium atmospheric composition calculation of the abundance of these molecules. Finally, we computed thermal emission spectra for a series of radiative-convective equilibrium models of cloudy and cloudless brown dwarf atmospheres (with $T_{\rm eff}=$ 500--2400~K, and $\log g$=4.0, 4.5, 5.0) to understand where the presence or absence of atmospheric lithium-bearing species is most easily detected as a function of brown dwarf mass and age.

In this paper, we study several under-explored dimensions of FI explanations, providing conceptual and empirical improvements for this form of explanation. First, we advance a new argument for why it can be problematic to remove features from an input when creating or evaluating explanations: the fact that these counterfactual inputs are out-of-distribution (OOD) to models implies that the resulting explanations are socially misaligned. The crux of the problem is that the model prior and random weight initialization influence the explanations (and explanation metrics) in unintended ways. To resolve this issue, we propose a simple alteration to the model training process, which results in more socially aligned explanations and metrics. Second, we compare among five approaches for removing features from model inputs. We find that some methods produce more OOD counterfactuals than others, and we make recommendations for selecting a feature-replacement function. Finally, we introduce four search-based methods for identifying FI explanations and compare them to strong baselines, including LIME, Anchors, and Integrated Gradients. Through experiments with six diverse text classification datasets, we find that the only method that consistently outperforms random search is a Parallel Local Search (PLS) that we introduce.

First, we present a graph signal denoiser by unrolling iterations of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). We then suggest a general restoration method for linear degradation by unrolling iterations of Plug-and-Play ADMM (PnP-ADMM). In the second approach, the unrolled ADMM-based denoiser is incorporated as a submodule, leading to a nested DAU structure. The parameters in the proposed denoising/restoration methods are trainable in an end-to-end manner. Our approach is interpretable and keeps the number of parameters small since we only tune graph-independent regularization parameters. We overcome two main challenges in existing graph signal restoration methods: 1) limited performance of convex optimization algorithms due to fixed parameters which are often determined manually. 2) large number of parameters of graph neural networks that result in difficulty of training. Several experiments for graph signal denoising and interpolation are performed on synthetic and real-world data. The proposed methods show performance improvements over several existing techniques in terms of root mean squared error in both tasks. ",Graph Signal Restoration Using Nested Deep Algorithm Unrolling

Our method is based on two main tasks: the first task predicts naturalness analysis based features adapted to stereo images, while the second task predicts the quality of such images. The former, so-called auxiliary task, aims to find more robust and relevant features to improve the quality prediction. To do this, we compute naturalness-based features using a Natural Scene Statistics (NSS) model in the complex wavelet domain. It allows to capture the statistical dependency between pairs of the stereoscopic images. Experiments are conducted on the well known LIVE PHASE I and LIVE PHASE II databases.

We report the first results of a systematic survey of faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the vicinity of the bright late-type spiral NGC 253 galaxy by means of a visual inspection of the images taken by the Dark Energy Survey. Three new dwarf galaxies have been discovered in the vicinity of the brightest member of the Sculptor filament, the late-type spiral NGC 253.

We first observe that the Lipschitz constant close to the training data affects various aspects of the parameter trajectory, with more complex networks having a longer trajectory, bigger variance, and often veering further from their initialization. We then show that NNs whose 1st layer bias is trained more steadily (i.e., slowly and with little variation) have bounded complexity even in regions of the input space that are far from any training point.

We operationalize this axiomatic thinking to reproduce rankings based on combinations of elementary constraints. This allows us to investigate to what extent the ranking decisions of neural rankers can be explained in terms of retrieval axioms, and which axioms apply in which situations. Our experimental study considers a comprehensive set of axioms over several representative neural rankers.

For the first three, we follow the practice of loss function formulation available in literature. For the fourth one, we propose novel loss functions inspired by RBP for both the pairwise and listwise scenario. Our results confirm that the best performance is indeed not necessarily achieved when optimizing the same metric being used for evaluation. In fact, we find that RBP-inspired losses perform at least as well as other metrics in a consistent way, and offer clear benefits in several cases. Interesting to see is that RBP-inspired losses, while improving the recommendation performance for all uses, may lead to an individual performance gain that is correlated with the activity level of a user in interacting with items. The more active the users, the more they benefit. Overall, our results challenge the assumption behind the current research practice of optimizing and evaluating the same metric, and point to RBP-based optimization instead as a promising alternative when learning to rank in the recommendation context.

We determine how the bulk properties and surface conditions of a water world affect its ocean depth, finding that oceans can be up to hundreds of times deeper than on Earth. For example, a planet with a 300 K surface can possess H$_2$O oceans with depths from 30-500 km, depending on its mass and composition. We also constrain the region of mass-radius space in which planets with H/He envelopes could host liquid H$_2$O, noting that the liquid phase can persist at temperatures up to 647 K at high pressures of $218$-$7\times10^4$ bar. Such H/He envelopes could contribute significantly to the planet radius while retaining liquid water at the surface, depending on the planet mass and temperature profile.

Existing Ref-SR methods mostly rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference images to compensate for the information loss in input images. However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and reference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the resolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose C2-Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing transformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution gap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the potential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the performance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the Webly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C2-Matching significantly outperforms state of the arts by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark. Notably, it also shows great generalizability on WR-SR dataset as well as robustness across large scale and rotation transformations. ",Robust Reference-based Super-Resolution via C2-Matching

To increase its robustness to outlier languages, we create two variants of MAML based on alternative criteria: Minimax MAML reduces the maximum risk across languages, while Neyman-Pearson MAML constrains the risk in each language to a maximum threshold. Both criteria constitute fully differentiable two-player games. In light of this, we propose a new adaptive optimiser solving for a local approximation to their Nash equilibrium.

To push representation convergence times down to minutes, we leverage meta learning to learn neural shape and image feature priors which accelerate training.

Additionally, we calculate the interlayer correlations, which have the effect of exponentially increasing the variance of the network output. Based on our analysis, we introduce Balanced ResNets, a simple architecture modification, which eliminates hypoactivation and interlayer correlations and is more amenable to theoretical analysis.

Jupiter has been the most well-studied giant planet in terms of its atmosphere; however, the origin of the Jovian atmospheric composition remains a puzzle as the abundances of nitrogen and noble gases as high as those of other elements could only originate from extremely cold environments. We propose a novel idea for explaining the Jovian atmospheric composition: Dust pileup at the H$_2$O snow line casts a shadow and cools the Jupiter orbit so that N$_2$ and noble gases can freeze. Planetesimals or a core formed in the shadowed region can enrich nitrogen and noble gases as much as other elements through their dissolution in the envelope. We compute the temperature structure of a shadowed protosolar disk with radiative transfer calculations. Then, we investigate the radial volatile distributions and predict the atmospheric composition of Jupiter with condensation calculations. We find that the vicinity of the current Jupiter orbit, approximately $3$--$7~{\rm AU}$, could be as cold as $30~{\rm K}$ if the small-dust surface density varies by a factor of $\gtrsim30$ across the H$_2$O snow line. According to previous grain growth simulations, this condition could be achieved by weak disk turbulence if silicate grains are more fragile than icy grains. The shadow can cause the condensation of most volatile substances, namely N$_2$ and Ar. We demonstrate that the dissolution of shadowed solids can explain the elemental abundance patterns of the Jovian atmosphere even if proto-Jupiter was formed near Jupiter's current orbit.

We model this region with the Explicit Planetary hybrid-Isentropic Coordinate model using its active microphysics scheme to study the phenomenology of water and ammonia clouds within the jet region. On perturbing the atmosphere, we find that an upper tropospheric wave develops that directly influences the cloud structure within the jet. This wave travels at $\sim75$ m/s in our model, and leads to periodic chevron-shaped features in the ammonia cloud deck. These features travel with the wave speed, and are subsequently much slower than the zonal wind at the cloud deck. The cloud structure, and the slower drift rate, were both observed following the convective outbreak in this region in 2016 and 2020. We find that an upper level circulation is responsible for these cloud features in the aftermath of the convective outbursts. The comparatively slower observed drift rates of these features, relative to the wind speed of the jet, provides constraints on the vertical wind shear above the cloud tops, and we suggest that wind velocities determined from cloud tracking should correspond to a different altitude compared to the $680$ hPa pressure level.

Such contingency aware IM is critical for applications for non-profit organizations in low resource communities (e.g., spreading awareness of disease prevention). Despite the initial success, a major practical obstacle in promoting the solutions to more communities is the tremendous runtime of the greedy algorithms and the lack of high performance computing (HPC) for the non-profits in the field -- whenever there is a new social network, the non-profits usually do not have the HPCs to recalculate the solutions.

We address a hybrid scenario where post-compaction merging satellites heat up the dark-matter cusps by dynamical friction, allowing AGN-driven outflows to generate cores. Using analytic and semi-analytic models (SatGen), we estimate the dynamical-friction heating as a function of satellite compactness for a cosmological sequence of mergers. Cosmological simulations (VELA) demonstrate that satellites of initial virial masses $>\!10^{11.3}M_\odot$, that undergo wet compactions, become sufficiently compact for significant heating. Constituting a major fraction of the accretion onto haloes $\geq\!10^{12}M_\odot$, these satellites heat-up the cusps in half a virial time at $z\!\sim\! 2$. Using a model for outflow-driven core formation (CuspCore), we demonstrate that the heated dark-matter cusps develop extended cores in response to removal of half the gas mass, while the more compact stellar systems remain intact. The mergers keep the dark matter hot, while the gas supply, fresh and recycled, is sufficient for the AGN outflows. AGN indeed become effective in haloes $\geq\!10^{12}M_\odot$, where the black-hole growth is no longer suppressed by supernovae and its compaction-driven rapid growth is maintained by a hot CGM.

For the strongest neutron-star fields, however, stresses build to the point of crustal failure, at which point the standard evolution equations are no longer valid. Here, we study the evolution of the magnetic field of the crust up to and beyond crustal failure, whence the crust begins to flow plastically. We perform global axisymmetric evolutions, exploring different types of failure affecting a limited region of the crust. We find that a plastic flow does not simply suppress the Hall effect even in the regime of a low plastic viscosity, but it rather leads to non-trivial evolution -- in some cases even overreacting and enhancing the impact of the Hall effect. Its impact is more pronouced in the toroidal field, with the differences on the poloidal field being less substantial.

In particular we point out a novel signal of kinetically mixed dark-photon dark matter: a monochromatic oscillating magnetic field generated at the surface of the Earth. Similar to the signal in a laboratory experiment in a shielded box (or cavity), this signal arises because the lower atmosphere is a low-conductivity air gap sandwiched between the highly conductive interior of the Earth below and ionosphere or interplanetary medium above. At low masses (frequencies) the signal in a laboratory detector is usually suppressed by the size of the detector multiplied by the dark-matter mass. Crucially, in our case the suppression is by the radius of the Earth, and not by the (much smaller) height of the atmosphere. We compute the size and global vectorial pattern of our magnetic field signal, which enables sensitive searches for this signal using unshielded magnetometers dispersed over the surface of the Earth. In principle, the signal we compute exists for any dark photon in the mass range $10^{-21} \text{eV}\lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 3\times 10^{-14} \text{eV}$. We summarize the results of our companion paper [arXiv:2108.08852], in which we detail such a search using a publicly available dataset from the SuperMAG Collaboration: we report no robust signal candidates and so place constraints in the (more limited) dark-photon dark-matter mass range $2\times 10^{-18} \text{eV} \lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 7\times 10^{-17} \text{eV}$ (corresponding to frequencies $6\times 10^{-4} \text{Hz}\lesssim f \lesssim 2\times 10^{-2} \text{Hz}$). These constraints are complementary to existing astrophysical bounds. Future searches for this signal may improve the sensitivity over a wide range of ultralight dark-matter candidates and masses.

In particular, the PB2 algorithm is able to achieve strong performance in RL tasks by formulating online hyperparameter optimization as time varying GP-bandit problem, while also providing theoretical guarantees. However, PB2 is only designed to work for continuous hyperparameters, which severely limits its utility in practice.

Often, graph signals are corrupted in the sensing process, thus requiring restoration. In this paper, we propose two graph signal restoration methods based on deep algorithm unrolling (DAU). First, we present a graph signal denoiser by unrolling iterations of the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). We then suggest a general restoration method for linear degradation by unrolling iterations of Plug-and-Play ADMM (PnP-ADMM). In the second approach, the unrolled ADMM-based denoiser is incorporated as a submodule, leading to a nested DAU structure. The parameters in the proposed denoising/restoration methods are trainable in an end-to-end manner. Our approach is interpretable and keeps the number of parameters small since we only tune graph-independent regularization parameters. We overcome two main challenges in existing graph signal restoration methods: 1) limited performance of convex optimization algorithms due to fixed parameters which are often determined manually. 2) large number of parameters of graph neural networks that result in difficulty of training. Several experiments for graph signal denoising and interpolation are performed on synthetic and real-world data. The proposed methods show performance improvements over several existing techniques in terms of root mean squared error in both tasks. ",Graph Signal Restoration Using Nested Deep Algorithm Unrolling

Single image super-resolution (SR) is a promising technique to provide HR images based on unsupervised learning to increase resolution of a 2D image, but there are few reports on 3D SR.
