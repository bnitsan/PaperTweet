In realistic biophysical single cell models, canards are responsible for several complex neural rhythms observed experimentally, but their existence and role in spatially-extended systems is largely unexplored. We describe a novel type of coherent structure in which a spatial pattern displays temporal canard behaviour. Using interfacial dynamics and geometric singular perturbation theory, we classify spatio-temporal canards and give conditions for the existence of folded-saddle and folded-node canards. We find that spatio-temporal canards are robust to changes in the synaptic connectivity and firing rate. The theory correctly predicts the existence of spatio-temporal canards with octahedral symmetries in a neural field model posed on the unit sphere. ",Spatio-temporal canards in neural field equations

Unfortunately, this vision hasn't come to fruition: in fact, developing and maintaining today's security machine learning systems can require engineering resources that are comparable to that of signature-based detection systems, due in part to the need to develop and continuously tune the ""features"" these machine learning systems look at as attacks evolve. Deep learning, a subfield of machine learning, promises to change this by operating on raw input signals and automating the process of feature design and extraction. In this paper we propose the eXpose neural network, which uses a deep learning approach we have developed to take generic, raw short character strings as input (a common case for security inputs, which include artifacts like potentially malicious URLs, file paths, named pipes, named mutexes, and registry keys), and learns to simultaneously extract features and classify using character-level embeddings and convolutional neural network. In addition to completely automating the feature design and extraction process, eXpose outperforms manual feature extraction based baselines on all of the intrusion detection problems we tested it on, yielding a 5%-10% detection rate gain at 0.1% false positive rate compared to these baselines.

Using an equation of state constructed from lattice calculations we determine the mass-radius-relation for a neutron star in this theory using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. The results exhibit an influence of the non-trivial interactions on the mass-radius relation. However, the masses of the quarks are found to have little influence.

In the GMC collision simulations, the final star formation rates and efficiencies are relatively independent of these parameters. Between non-colliding and colliding cases, we compare the morphologies of the resulting star clusters, properties of star-forming gas, time evolution of the star formation rate (SFR), spatial clustering of the stars, and resulting kinematics of the stars in comparison to the natal gas.

The proposed technique reconstructs the image from the visibility amplitude and closure phase, which are standard data products of short-millimeter very long baseline interferometers such as the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and optical/infrared interferometers, by utilizing two regularization functions: the $\ell_1$-norm and total variation (TV) of the brightness distribution. In the proposed method, optimal regularization parameters, which represent the sparseness and effective spatial resolution of the image, are derived from data themselves using cross validation (CV). As an application of this technique, we present simulated observations of M87 with the EHT based on four physically motivated models. We confirm that $\ell_1$+TV regularization can achieve an optimal resolution of $\sim 20-30$% of the diffraction limit $\lambda/D_{\rm max}$, which is the nominal spatial resolution of a radio interferometer. With the proposed technique, the EHT can robustly and reasonably achieve super-resolution sufficient to clearly resolve the black hole shadow.

Cosmic rays accelerated by the supernova may receive an energy boost when crossing the accretion-powered jet. The rate of encounters between WDs and IMBHs can be relatively high, as the number of IMBHs may be substantially augmented once account is taken of their likely presence in dwarf galaxies.

Early predictions had suggested 1ES 1741+196 to be, along with several other high-frequency BL Lac sources, within the reach of MAGIC detectability. Its detection by MAGIC, later confirmed by VERITAS, helps to expand the small population of known TeV BL Lacs. The source was observed with the MAGIC telescopes between 2010 April and 2011 May, collecting 46 h of good quality data.

Recently, a space of unrooted phylogenetic networks was introduced, where such a network is a connected graph in which every vertex has degree 1 or 3 and whose leaf-set is a fixed set $X$ of taxa. This space, denoted $\mathcal{N}(X)$, is defined in terms of two operations on networks -- the nearest neighbor interchange and triangle operations -- which can be used to transform any network with leaf set $X$ into any other network with that leaf set. In particular, it gives rise to a metric $d$ on $\mathcal N(X)$ which is given by the smallest number of operations required to transform one network in $\mathcal N(X)$ into another in $\mathcal N(X)$. The metric generalizes the well-known NNI-metric on phylogenetic trees which has been intensively studied in the literature.

Recently, neural-network based methods have been proposed for learning this representation from large corpora. This type of word-to-vector embedding is able to keep, in the learned vector space, some of the syntactic and semantic relationships present in the original word corpus. This, in turn, serves to address different types of language classification tasks by doing algebraic operations defined on the vectors. The general practice is to assume that the semantic relationships between the words can be inferred by the application of a-priori specified algebraic operations. Our general goal in this paper is to show that it is possible to learn methods for word composition in semantic spaces. Instead of expressing the compositional method as an algebraic operation, we will encode it as a program, which can be linear, nonlinear, or involve more intricate expressions. More remarkably, this program will be evolved from a set of initial random programs by means of genetic programming (GP). We show that our method is able to reproduce the same behavior as human-designed algebraic operators. Using a word analogy task as benchmark, we also show that GP-generated programs are able to obtain accuracy values above those produced by the commonly used human-designed rule for algebraic manipulation of word vectors.

The model is based on the RuleFit approach in Friedman and Popescu (2008) where rules from decision trees and linear terms are used in a L1-regularized regression. We modify RuleFit by replacing the L1-regularization by a horseshoe prior, which is well known to give aggressive shrinkage of noise predictor while leaving the important signal essentially untouched. This is especially important when a large number of rules are used as predictors as many of them only contribute noise. Our horseshoe prior has an additional hierarchical layer that applies more shrinkage a priori to rules with a large number of splits, and to rules that are only satisfied by a few observations. The aggressive noise shrinkage of our prior also makes it possible to complement the rules from boosting in Friedman and Popescu (2008) with an additional set of trees from random forest, which brings a desirable diversity to the ensemble. We sample from the posterior distribution using a very efficient and easily implemented Gibbs sampler. The new model is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods like RuleFit, BART and random forest on 16 datasets. The model and its interpretation is demonstrated on the well known Boston housing data, and on gene expression data for cancer classification. The posterior sampling, prediction and graphical tools for interpreting the model results are implemented in a publicly available R package.

Humans exploit knowledge of objects and their relations for learning a wide spectrum of tasks, and more generally when learning the structure underlying observed data. In this work, we introduce relation networks (RNs) - a general purpose neural network architecture for object-relation reasoning. We show that RNs are capable of learning object relations from scene description data. Furthermore, we show that RNs can act as a bottleneck that induces the factorization of objects from entangled scene description inputs, and from distributed deep representations of scene images provided by a variational autoencoder. The model can also be used in conjunction with differentiable memory mechanisms for implicit relation discovery in one-shot learning tasks.

This enables to identify cell sub-types, and to determine their relative proportions. Improvements of this technology allow to describe millions of individual cells from a blood sample using multiple markers. This results in high-dimensional datasets, whose manual analysis is highly time-consuming and poorly reproducible. While several methods have been developed to perform automatic recognition of cell populations, most of them treat and analyze each sample independently. However, in practice, individual samples are rarely independent (e.g. longitudinal studies). Here, we propose to use a Bayesian nonparametric approach with Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) of multivariate skew $t$-distributions to perform model based clustering of flow-cytometry data. DPM models directly estimate the number of cell populations from the data, avoiding model selection issues, and skew $t$-distributions provides robustness to outliers and non-elliptical shape of cell populations. To accommodate repeated measurements, we propose a sequential strategy relying on a parametric approximation of the posterior. We illustrate the good performance of our method on simulated data, on an experimental benchmark dataset, and on new longitudinal data from the DALIA-1 trial which evaluates a therapeutic vaccine against HIV. On the benchmark dataset, the sequential strategy outperforms all other methods evaluated, and similarly, leads to improved performance on the DALIA-1 data.

These smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners. Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming languages have a serial semantics. This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and ""discovering"" a serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently.

In general, though, these clearing solutions are not unique. We extend this result by considering the t\^atonnement process to find the unique attained equilibrium. The attained equilibrium need not be continuous with respect to the initial shock; these points of discontinuity match those stresses in which a financial crisis becomes a systemic crisis. We further provide mathematical formulations for payment rules and utility functions satisfying the necessary conditions for these existence and uniqueness results. We demonstrate the value of our model through illustrative numerical case studies. In particular, we study a counterfactual scenario on the event that Greece re-instituted the drachma on a dataset from the European Banking Authority.

My new paper on multiplex network regression is on arXiv: <LINK> <LINK>'],https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02048,"We introduce a statistical regression model to investigate the impact of dyadic relations on complex networks generated from observed repeated interactions. It is based on generalised hypergeometric ensembles (gHypEG), a class of statistical network ensembles developed recently to deal with multi-edge graph and count data. We represent different types of known relations between system elements by weighted graphs, separated in the different layers of a multiplex network. With our method, we can regress the influence of each relational layer, the explanatory variables, on the interaction counts, the dependent variables. Moreover, we can quantify the statistical significance of the relations as explanatory variables for the observed interactions. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we investigate an example based on empirical data. ",Multiplex Network Regression: How do relations drive interactions?

In recent years, efforts have been made to extend these models to temporal dynamic networks, whereby the connections between nodes are observed at a number of different times. In this paper we extend the original stochastic block model by using a Markovian property to describe the evolution of nodes' cluster memberships over time. We recast the problem of clustering the nodes of the network into a model-based context, and show that the integrated completed likelihood can be evaluated analytically for a number of likelihood models. Then, we propose a scalable greedy algorithm to maximise this quantity, thereby estimating both the optimal partition and the ideal number of groups in a single inferential framework. Finally we propose applications of our methodology to both real and artificial datasets. ","Choosing the number of groups in a latent stochastic block model for

First, we revisit the theory of transmission spectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission spectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a reference transit radius, which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We show that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius, the assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the inferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a WFC3 transmission spectrum. Second, we show that the transmission spectra of isothermal atmospheres are nearly isobaric. We validate the isothermal, isobaric analytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full numerical calculations and show that the typical errors are ~0.1% (~10 ppm) within the WFC3 range of wavelengths for temperatures of 1500 K (or higher). Third, we generalize the previous expression for the transit radius to include a small temperature gradient. Finally, we analyze the measured WFC3 transmission spectrum of WASP-12b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the retrieval approach of Kreidberg et al. (2015) if the reference transit radius and reference pressure are fixed to assumed values. The unknown functional relationship between the reference transit radius and reference pressure implies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure that is being retrieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone. This degeneracy leads to a limitation on how accurately we may extract molecular abundances from transmission spectra using WFC3 data alone. Finally, we compare our study to that of Griffith (2014) and discuss why the degeneracy was missed in previous retrieval studies.
