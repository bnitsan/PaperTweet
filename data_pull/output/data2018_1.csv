You’ll like the last two figures']",https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09699,"Understanding the processes that drive the formation of black holes (BHs) is a key topic in observational cosmology. While the observed $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ correlation in bulge-dominated galaxies is thought to be produced by major mergers, the existence of a $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, across all galaxy morphological types, suggests that BHs may be largely built by secular processes. Recent evidence that bulge-less galaxies, which are unlikely to have had significant mergers, are offset from the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but lie on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, has strengthened this hypothesis. Nevertheless, the small size and heterogeneity of current datasets, coupled with the difficulty in measuring precise BH masses, makes it challenging to address this issue using empirical studies alone. Here, we use Horizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to probe the role of mergers in BH growth over cosmic time. We show that (1) as suggested by observations, simulated bulge-less galaxies lie offset from the main $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\mathrm{Bulge}}$ relation, but on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation, (2) the positions of galaxies on the $M_{\mathrm{BH}}$--$M_{\star}$ relation are not affected by their merger histories and (3) only $\sim$35 per cent of the BH mass in today's massive galaxies is directly attributable to merging -- the majority ($\sim$65 per cent) of BH growth, therefore, takes place gradually, via secular processes, over cosmic time.

What such intelligence does after becoming aware is not so certain. To that end, research suggests that the likelihood of artificial general intelligence becoming hostile to humans is significant enough to warrant inquiry into methods to limit such potential. Thus, containment of artificial general intelligence is a timely and meaningful research topic. While there is limited research exploring possible containment strategies, such work is bounded by the underlying field the strategies draw upon. Accordingly, we set out to construct an ontology to describe necessary elements in any future containment technology. Using existing academic literature, we developed a single domain ontology containing five levels, 32 codes, and 32 associated descriptors. Further, we constructed ontology diagrams to demonstrate intended relationships. We then identified humans, AGI, and the cyber world as novel agent objects necessary for future containment activities. Collectively, the work addresses three critical gaps: (a) identifying and arranging fundamental constructs; (b) situating AGI containment within cyber science; and (c) developing scientific rigor within the field.

However, much research is conducted at the level of individual news articles, despite the fact that news events (especially significant ones) are frequently presented as ""stories"" by news outlets: chains of connected articles covering the same event from different angles. These stories are theoretically highly important in terms of increasing public recall of news items and enhancing the agenda-setting power of the press. Yet thus far, the field has lacked an efficient method for detecting groups of articles which form stories in a way that enables their analysis. In this work, we present a novel, automated method for identifying linked news stories from within a corpus of articles. This method makes use of techniques drawn from the field of information retrieval to identify textual closeness of pairs of articles, and then clustering techniques taken from the field of network analysis to group these articles into stories. We demonstrate the application of the method to a corpus of 61,864 articles, and show how it can efficiently identify valid story clusters within the corpus. We use the results to make observations about the prevalence and dynamics of stories within the UK news media, showing that more than 50% of news production takes place within stories.

According to Holm (Proc Roy Soc, 2015) and Cotter et al.

In the current paper, we develop new methodology to implement this velocity decomposition and then numerically integrate the resulting stochastic partial differential equation using a finite element discretisation for incompressible 2D Euler fluid flows. The new methodology tested here is found to be suitable for coarse graining in this case. Specifically, we perform uncertainty quantification tests of the velocity decomposition of Cotter et al. (2017), by comparing ensembles of coarse-grid realisations of solutions of the resulting stochastic partial differential equation with the ""true solutions"" of the deterministic fluid partial differential equation, computed on a refined grid. The time discretization used for approximating the solution of the stochastic partial differential equation is shown to be consistent.

Traditional methods of localization, which filter the belief based on the observations, are sub-optimal in the number of steps required, as they do not decide the actions taken by the agent. We propose ""Active Neural Localizer"", a fully differentiable neural network that learns to localize accurately and efficiently. The proposed model incorporates ideas of traditional filtering-based localization methods, by using a structured belief of the state with multiplicative interactions to propagate belief, and combines it with a policy model to localize accurately while minimizing the number of steps required for localization. Active Neural Localizer is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning. We use a variety of simulation environments for our experiments which include random 2D mazes, random mazes in the Doom game engine and a photo-realistic environment in the Unreal game engine. The results on the 2D environments show the effectiveness of the learned policy in an idealistic setting while results on the 3D environments demonstrate the model's capability of learning the policy and perceptual model jointly from raw-pixel based RGB observations. We also show that a model trained on random textures in the Doom environment generalizes well to a photo-realistic office space environment in the Unreal engine. ",Active Neural Localization

Recent projects such as Illustris are capable of producing simulated images that are comparable to those obtained from local surveys. This paper tests how well Illustris achieves this goal across a diverse population of galaxies using visual morphologies derived from Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists. Morphological classifications provided by volunteers for simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample of images drawn from the SDSS Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple morphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth from featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images. Differences are identified, which are likely due to the limited resolution of the simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical evolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes. Specifically, for stellar masses $M_{\star}\lesssim10^{11}M_{\odot}$, a larger proportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible substructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses, simulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar morphology distributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent behavior confirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris simulated images. When $M_{\star}\gtrsim10^{11}M_{\odot}$, the Illustris dataset contains fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously featured.

In gas rich environments, it has been shown that a putative extended, steady circumbinary gaseous disc plays an important role in the MBHB evolution, facilitating its coalescence. How gas on galactic scales is transported to the nuclear region to form and maintain such a stable structure is, however, unclear. If, following a galaxy merger, turbulent gas is condenses in cold clumps and filaments that are randomly scattered, gas is naturally transported on parsec scales and interacts with the MBHB in discrete incoherent pockets. The aim of this work is to investigate the gaseous structures arising from this interaction. We employ a suite of smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic simulations to study the formation and evolution of gaseous structures around a MBHB constantly perturbed by the incoherent infall of molecular clouds. We investigate the influence of the infall rate and angular momentum distribution of the clouds on the geometry and stability of the arising structures. We find that the continuous supply of incoherent clouds is a double-edge sword, resulting in the intermittent formation and disruption of circumbinary structures. Anisotropic cloud distributions featuring an excess of co-rotating events generate more prominent co-rotating circumbinary discs. Similar structures are seen when mostly counter-rotating clouds are fed to the binary, even though they are more compact and less stable. In general, our simulations do not show the formation of extended smooth and stable circumbinary discs, typically assumed in analytical and numerical investigations of the the long term evolution of MBHBs.

As stars ascend the giant branch their envelope density drops and so does the power injected through orbital decay, scaling approximately as $L_{\rm decay} \propto R_*^{-9/2}$. Their luminosity, however, increases along the giant branch. These opposed scalings indicate a crossing, where $L_{\rm decay}= L_*$. We consider the engulfment of planets along isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram. We find that the conditions for such a crossing occur around $L_*\approx 10^2$~$L_\odot$ (or $a\approx 0.1$~au) for Jovian planetary companions. The consumption of closer-in giant planets, such as hot Jupiters, leads to $L_{\rm decay}\gg L_*$, while more distant planets such as warm Jupiters, $a\approx 0.5$~au, lead to minor perturbations of their host stars with $L_{\rm decay} \ll L_*$. Our results map out the parameter space along the giant branch in the H-R Diagram where interaction with planetary companions leads to significant energetic disturbance of host stars.

Although two events hardly constitute a statistically significant demonstration of a geographical pattern of impacts, their spatial coincidence is at least tantalizing. To understand if this concurrence reflects an underlying geographical and/or temporal pattern, we must aim at predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of meteoroid impacts on Earth. For this purpose we designed, implemented and tested a novel numerical technique, the ""Gravitational Ray Tracing"" (GRT) designed to compute the relative impact probability (RIP) on the surface of any planet. GRT is inspired by the so-called ray-casting techniques used to render realistic images of complex 3D scenes. In this paper we describe the method and the results of testing it at the time of large impact events. Our findings suggest a non-trivial pattern of impact probabilities at any given time on Earth. Locations at $60-90\deg$ from the apex are more prone to impacts, especially at midnight. Counterintuitively, sites close to apex direction have the lowest RIP, while in the antapex RIP are slightly larger than average. We present here preliminary maps of RIP at the time of Tunguska and Chelyabinsk events and found no evidence of a spatial or temporal pattern, suggesting that their coincidence was fortuitous. We apply the GRT method to compute theoretical RIP at the location and time of 394 large fireballs.

The curl operation involved in finding the Nye tensor, while conceptually straightforward has been marred with inconsistencies and several different definitions are in use. For the three most common definitions, we show that their consistent application leads to the same result. To eliminate frequently encountered confusion, a summary of expressions for Nye's tensor in terms of elastic and plastic deformation gradient, and for both small and large deformations, is presented. A further question when estimating GND density concerns the optimization technique used to solve the under-determined set of equations linking Nye's tensor and GND density. A systematic comparison of the densities obtained by two widely used techniques, L1 and L2 minimisation, shows that both methods yield remarkably similar total GND densities. Thus the mathematically simpler, L2, may be preferred over L1 except when information about the distribution of densities on specific slip systems is required. To illustrate this, we compare experimentally measured lattice distortions beneath nano-indents in pure tungsten, probed using 3D-resolved synchrotron X-ray micro-diffraction, with those predicted by 3D strain-gradient crystal plasticity finite element calculations. The results are in good agreement and show that the volumetric component of the elastic strain field has a surprisingly small effect on the determined Nye tensor.

A sinusoidal modulation at the binary orbital period was also present with an amplitude of ~16%, which varied by a few percent over timescales of days, and with a maximum that took place 890 +/- 85 s earlier than the superior conjunction of the donor. We interpret these phenomena in terms of reprocessing of the X-ray emission by an asymmetrically heated companion star surface and/or a non-axisymmetric outflow possibly launched close to the inner Lagrangian point. Furthermore, the non-flaring average emission varied by up to ~ 40% over a time scale of days in the absence of correspondingly large variations of the irradiating X-ray flux.

In addition, we propose a strategy for data-adaptive causal effect estimation that does not rely on the strict overlap assumption. These findings reveal the stringency that accompanies the use of the treatment positivity assumption in high-dimensional settings.

In contrast with conservative glide motion, climb relies on the point defects' thermal diffusion and hence operates on much longer timescales, leading to some forms of creep. Whilst equilibrium point defect concentrations allow dislocations to climb to relieve non-glide stresses, point defect supersaturations also lead to osmotic forces, driving dislocation motion even in the absence of external stresses. Self-interstitial atoms typically have significantly higher formation energies than vacancies, so their contribution to climb is usually ignored. However, under irradiation conditions, both types of defect are athermally created in equal numbers. In this letter, we use simple thermodynamic arguments to show that the contribution of interstitials cannot be neglected in irradiated materials, and that the osmotic force they induce on dislocations is many orders of magnitude larger than that caused by vacancies. This explains why the prismatic dislocation loops observed by {\it in situ} transmission electron microscope irradiations are more often of interstitial rather than vacancy character. Using discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, we investigate the effect on dislocation-obstacle interactions, and find reductions in the depinning time of many orders of magnitude. This has important consequences for the strength of particle-reinforced alloys under irradiation. ","Interstitial-mediated dislocation climb and the weakening of

There are well-known kernelization algorithms for it, which get a hypergraph $H$ and a number $k$ as input and output a hypergraph $H'$ such that (1) $H$ has a hitting set of size $k$ if, and only if, $H'$ has such a hitting set and (2) the size of $H'$ depends only on $k$ and on the maximum cardinality $d$ of edges in $H$.

Recently, it has been shown that one of them can be parallelized to a certain degree: one can compute hitting set kernels in parallel time $O(d)$ -- but it was conjectured that this is the best parallel algorithm possible. We refute this conjecture and show how hitting set kernels can be computed in constant parallel time.

The data cover a small range of Galactocentric radius ($7.9 \leq R_\mathrm{GC} \leq 9.5$ kpc), but extend up to 4 kpc in height from the Galactic plane, and several kpc in the direction of Galactic anti-rotation (at longitude $260 ^\circ \leq \ell \leq 280^\circ$). This allows us to reliably measure the vertical density and abundance profiles of the chemically and kinematically defined `thick' and `thin' disks of the Galaxy. The thin disk (low-$\alpha$ population) exhibits a steep negative vertical metallicity gradient, at d[M/H]/d$z=-0.18 \pm 0.01$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, which is broadly consistent with previous studies. In contrast, its vertical $\alpha$-abundance profile is almost flat, with a gradient of d[$\alpha$/M]/d$z$ = $0.008 \pm 0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. The steep vertical metallicity gradient of the low-$\alpha$ population is in agreement with models where radial migration has a major role in the evolution of the thin disk. The thick disk (high-$\alpha$ population) has a weaker vertical metallicity gradient d[M/H]/d$z = -0.058 \pm 0.003$ dex kpc$^{-1}$.

Therefore, causal inference regarding the treatment effect is not as straightforward as in a randomized trial. To adjust for confounding due to measured covariates, a variety of methods based on the potential outcomes framework are used to estimate average treatment effects. One of the key assumptions is treatment positivity, which states that the probability of treatment is bounded away from zero and one for any possible combination of the confounders. Methods for performing causal inference when this assumption is violated are relatively limited. In this article, we discuss a new balance-related condition involving the convex hulls of treatment groups, which I term relaxed covariate overlap. An advantage of this concept is that it can be linked to a concept from machine learning, termed the margin. Introduction of relaxed covariate overlap leads to an approach in which one can perform causal inference in a three-step manner. The methodology is illustrated with two examples.

In general backscattering is challenging to interpret for a wide range of particle concentrations, because multiple scattering cannot be ignored, except in the very dilute range. Across the concentration range from 1% to 20% we find that the mean backscattered wave field is sufficient to accurately determine the concentration of particles. However, to accurately determine the particle radius, the second moment, or average intensity, of the backscattering is necessary.

The goals are to inform the future use of analytic models and to explore observable properties of the simulated halos in the context of UFD data. Specifically, we look at analytic approaches that might inform metal enrichment within and beyond small galaxies in the early Universe.

We show that modeling interventions at the level of susceptibility lead to an interesting family of new questions in network opinion dynamics.

We give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal target-set to optimize the sum of opinions when there are no budget constraints on the size of the target-set.

Finally, we propose a heuristic for the budgeted opinion optimization and show its efficacy at finding target-sets that optimize the sum of opinions compared on real world networks, including a Twitter network with real opinion estimates.

We observe that PPOKFAC is able to outperform PPO in terms of sample complexity and speed in a range of MuJoCo environments, while being scalable in terms of batch size. In spite of this, it seems that adding more epochs is not necessarily helpful for sample efficiency, and PPOKFAC seems to be worse than its A2C counterpart, ACKTR.

Observations include data from HIRES, PFS, CHIRON, and HARPS, where 1,111 measurements were made over 16 years. Our best solution for HD26965 $b$ is consistent with a super-Earth that has a minimum mass of 6.92$\pm$0.79 M$_{\oplus}$ orbiting at a distance of 0.215$\pm$0.008 AU from its host star. We have analyzed the correlation between spectral activity indicators and the radial velocities from each instrument, showing moderate correlations that we include in our model. From this analysis, we recover a $\sim$38 day signal, which matches some literature values of the stellar rotation period. However, from independent Mt. Wilson HK data for this star, we find evidence for a significant 42 day signal after subtraction of longer period magnetic cycles, casting doubt on the planetary hypothesis for this period. Although our statistical model strongly suggests that the 42-day signal is Doppler in origin, we conclude that the residual effects of stellar rotation are difficult to fully model and remove from this dataset, highlighting the difficulties to disentangle small planetary signals and photospheric noise, particularly when the orbital periods are close to the rotation period of the star.

The origin of these diverse, and possibly distinct, stellar populations in the Galactic disc is not well understood. We examine the Fe and $\alpha$-element evolution of 133 Milky Way-like galaxies from the EAGLE simulation, to investigate the origin and diversity of their $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ distributions. We find that bimodal $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ distributions arise in galaxies whose gas accretion histories exhibit episodes of significant infall at both early and late times, with the former fostering more intense star formation than the latter. The shorter characteristic consumption timescale of gas accreted in the earlier episode suppresses its enrichment with iron synthesised by Type Ia SNe, resulting in the formation of a high-$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ sequence. We find that bimodality in $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ similar to that seen in the Galaxy is rare, appearing in approximately 5 percent of galaxies in our sample. We posit that this is a consequence of an early gas accretion episode requiring the mass accretion history of a galaxy's dark matter halo to exhibit a phase of atypically-rapid growth at early epochs. The scarcity of EAGLE galaxies exhibiting distinct sequences in the $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ plane may therefore indicate that the Milky Way's elemental abundance patterns, and its accretion history, are not representative of the broader population of $\sim L^\star$ disc galaxies.

In other words, most images in the data distribution are both correctly classified by the model and are very close to a visually similar misclassified image. Despite substantial research interest, the cause of the phenomenon is still poorly understood and remains unsolved. We hypothesize that this counter intuitive behavior is a naturally occurring result of the high dimensional geometry of the data manifold. As a first step towards exploring this hypothesis, we study a simple synthetic dataset of classifying between two concentric high dimensional spheres. For this dataset we show a fundamental tradeoff between the amount of test error and the average distance to nearest error. In particular, we prove that any model which misclassifies a small constant fraction of a sphere will be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations of size $O(1/\sqrt{d})$. Surprisingly, when we train several different architectures on this dataset, all of their error sets naturally approach this theoretical bound. As a result of the theory, the vulnerability of neural networks to small adversarial perturbations is a logical consequence of the amount of test error observed. We hope that our theoretical analysis of this very simple case will point the way forward to explore how the geometry of complex real-world data sets leads to adversarial examples.

In this paper, we shed light on these questions by analyzing 27K tweets posted by 1K Twitter users identified as having ties with Russia's Internet Research Agency and thus likely state-sponsored trolls. We compare their behavior to a random set of Twitter users, finding interesting differences in terms of the content they disseminate, the evolution of their account, as well as their general behavior and use of Twitter. Then, using Hawkes Processes, we quantify the influence that trolls had on the dissemination of news on social platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and 4chan. Overall, our findings indicate that Russian trolls managed to stay active for long periods of time and to reach a substantial number of Twitter users with their tweets.

Unfortunately, even a seemingly innocuous benchmarking mistake can compromise the guarantees provided by a given systems security defense and also put its reproducibility and comparability at risk. This threat is particularly insidious as it is generally not a result of malice and can easily go undetected by both authors and reviewers. Moreover, as modern defenses often trade off security for performance in an attempt to find an ideal design point in the performance-security space, the damage caused by benchmarking mistakes is increasingly worrisome. To analyze the magnitude of the phenomenon, we identify a set of 22 ""benchmarking crimes"" that threaten the validity of systems security evaluations and perform a survey of 50 defense papers published in top venues. To ensure the validity of our results, we perform the complete survey twice, with two independent readers. We find only a very small number of disagreements between readers, showing that our assessment of benchmarking crimes is highly reproducible. We show that benchmarking crimes are widespread even in papers published at tier-1 venues. We find that tier-1 papers commit an average of five benchmarking crimes and we find only a single paper in our sample that committed no benchmarking crimes. Moreover, we find that the scale of the problem is constant over time, suggesting that the community is not yet addressing it despite the problem being now more relevant than ever. This threatens the scientific process, which relies on reproducibility and comparability to ensure that published research advances the state of the art. We hope to raise awareness of these issues and provide recommendations to improve benchmarking quality and safeguard the scientific process in our community.
