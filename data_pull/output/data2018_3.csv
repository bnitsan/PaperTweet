In this study, participants were provided a mobile phone to use as their primary phone. This phone was loaded with a custom keyboard that collected metadata consisting of keypress entry time and accelerometer movement. Individual character data with the exceptions of the backspace key and space bar were not collected due to privacy concerns. We propose an end-to-end deep architecture based on late fusion, named DeepMood, to model the multi-view metadata for the prediction of mood scores.

This contribution aims at linking a co-evolutionary perspective on such systems with morphogenesis, and therein at bringing a novel conceptual approach to the bottom-up design of complex systems which allows to fully consider co-evolutive processes. We first situate systems of interest at the interface between biological and social systems, and introduce a multidisciplinary perspective on co-evolution. Building on Holland's signals and boundaries theory of complex adaptive systems, we finally suggest that morphogenetic systems are equivalent to combinations of co-evolutionary niches. This introduces an entry to morphogenetic engineering focused on co-evolution between components of a system.

However, in a world that is more connected than ever, the choices of the people we interact with increasingly affect our privacy. This forces us to rethink our definition of privacy. We here formalize and study, as local and global node- and edge-observability, Bloustein's concept of group privacy. We prove edge-observability to be independent of the graph structure, while node-observability depends only on the degree distribution of the graph. We show on synthetic datasets that, for attacks spanning several hops such as those implemented by social networks and current US laws, the presence of hubs increases node-observability while a high clustering coefficient decreases it, at fixed density. We then study the edge-observability of a large real-world mobile phone dataset over a month and show that, even under the restricted two-hops rule, compromising as little as 1% of the nodes leads to observing up to 46% of all communications in the network. More worrisome, we also show that on average 36\% of each person's communications would be locally edge-observable under the same rule. Finally, we use real sensing data to show how people living in cities are vulnerable to distributed node-observability attacks. Using a smartphone app to compromise 1\% of the population, an attacker could monitor the location of more than half of London's population. Taken together, our results show that the current individual-centric approach to privacy and data protection does not encompass the realities of modern life.

At its core, this challenge arises from the fact that the effects of both decoherence and experimental noise can mimic that of information scrambling, leading to decay of OTOCs. Here, we analyze a quantum teleportation protocol that explicitly enables one to differentiate between scrambling and decoherence. Moreover, we demonstrate that within this protocol, one can extract a precise ""noise"" parameter which quantitatively captures the non-scrambling induced decay of OTOCs.

In searches in all-hadronic final states in the CMS and ATLAS experiments, the angle $\Delta\varphi_i$, the azimuthal angle between a jet and the missing transverse momentum, is widely used to reduce QCD multijet background events with large missing transverse momentum, which is primarily caused by a jet momentum mismeasurement or neutrinos in hadron decays-the missing transverse momentum is aligned with a jet. A related angular variable-denoted by $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$, the minimum of the azimuthal angles between a jet and the transverse momentum imbalance of the other jets in the event-is used instead in a series of searches in all-hadronic final states in CMS to suppress QCD multijet background events to a negligible level. In this paper, before introducing the alternative variables, we review the variable $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$ in detail and identify room for improvement, in particular, to maintain good acceptances for signal models with high jet multiplicity final states. Furthermore, we demonstrate with simulated event samples that $\hat{\omega}_\text{min}$ and $\chi_\text{min}$ considerably outperform $\Delta\varphi^*_\text{min}$ and $\Delta\varphi_i$ in rejecting QCD multijet background events and that $\hat{\omega}_\text{min}$ and $\tilde{\omega}_\text{min}$ are also useful for reducing the total standard model background events.

One possible way to reason about the structural health of such a railway bridge, is to model the time it takes to recover to a no-load (baseline) state after a train passes over. Inherently, this recovery time is random and should be modelled statistically. This paper uses a non-parametric model, based on empirical quantile approximations, to construct a space-memory efficient baseline distribution for the streaming data from these sensors. A fast statistical test is implemented to detect deviations away from, and recovery back to, this distribution when trains pass over the bridge, yielding a recovery time. Our method assumes that there are no temporal variations in the data. A median-based detrending scheme is used to remove the temporal variations likely due to temperature changes. This allows for the continuous recording of sensor data with a space-memory constraint. ","A Quantile-Based Approach to Modelling Recovery Time in Structural

Such theories have been used to cast doubt on the habitability of ocean worlds. However, Levi et al (2017) have recently proposed a mechanism by which CO2 is mobilized between the atmosphere and the interior of an ocean world. At high enough CO2 pressures, sea ice can become enriched in CO2 clathrates and sink after a threshold density is achieved. The presence of subpolar sea ice is of great importance for habitability in ocean worlds. It may moderate the climate and is fundamental in current theories of life formation in diluted environments. Here, we model the Levi et al. mechanism and use latitudinally-dependent non-grey energy balance and single-column radiative-convective climate models and find that this mechanism may be sustained on ocean worlds that rotate at least 3 times faster than the Earth. We calculate the circumstellar region in which this cycle may operate for G-M-stars (Teff = 2,600 to 5,800 K), extending from about 1.23 to 1.65, 0.69 to 0.954, 0.38 to 0.528 AU, 0.219 to 0.308 AU, 0.146 to 0.206 AU, and 0.0428 to 0.0617 AU for G2, K2, M0, M3, M5, and M8 stars, respectively.

The efficiency of the transfer is suppressed by not only the gauge kinetic mixing coupling but also the ratio between the large electric conductivity and the typical momentum of the magnetic fields.

Wind clumping close to the star and microturbulence can often be accounted for when including small-scale, sub-photospheric density or velocity perturbations. Compressional waves - with wavelengths comparable to or shorter than the gas pressure scale height - can be destabilized by the radiative flux in optically-thick media when a magnetic field is present, in a process called the Radiation-Driven Magneto-Acoustic Instability (RMI). The instability does not require radiation or magnetic pressure to dominate over gas pressure, and acts independently of sub-surface convection zones. Here we evaluate the conditions for the RMI to operate on a grid of stellar models covering a mass range $3-40M_\odot$ at solar metallicity. For a uniform 1kG magnetic field, fast magnetosonic modes are unstable down to an optical depth of a few tens, while unstable slow modes extend beyond the depth of the iron convection zone. The qualitative behavior is robust to magnetic field strength variations by a factor of a few. When combining our findings with previous results for the saturation amplitude of the RMI, we predict velocity fluctuations in the range ~0.1-10 km/s.

Quantum-interference conductance oscillations have indeed been predicted for multiwall carbon nanotube shuttles and telescopes, and arise from atomic-scale displacements between the inner and outer tubes. Previous theoretical work on graphene bilayers indicates that these systems may display similar interference features as a function of the relative position of the two sheets. Experimental verification is, however, still lacking.

Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of bowtie-shaped nanoconstrictions with mechanically controlled break junctions (MCBJs) made from a single layer of graphene. We find that their electrical conductance displays pronounced oscillations at room temperature, with amplitudes that modulate over an order of magnitude as a function of sub-nanometer displacements.

A main focus of this paper is to evaluate the combined effects of dark matter physics and stellar feedback on the well-known small-scale issues found in cold dark matter (CDM) models. We find that the $z=0$ stellar mass of a galaxy is strongly correlated with the central density of its host dark matter halo at the time of formation, $z_{\rm f}$, in both CDM and WDM models. WDM halos follow the same $M_{\star}(z=0)-V_{\rm max}(z_{\rm f})$ relation as in CDM, but they form later, are less centrally dense, and therefore contain galaxies that are less massive than their CDM counterparts. As a result, the impact of baryonic effects on the central gravitational potential is typically diminished relative to CDM. However, the combination of delayed formation in WDM and energy input from stellar feedback results in dark matter profiles with lower overall densities. The WDM galaxies studied here have a wider diversity of star formation histories (SFHs) than the same systems simulated in CDM, and the two lowest $M_{\star}$ WDM galaxies form all of their stars at late times.

Using perturbation theory, we show that these nonlinearities can provide a significant contaminant to lensing reconstruction, even for observations at reionization-era redshifts. However, we show how this contamination can be mitigated with the use of a ""bias-hardened"" estimator. Along the way, we present an estimator for reconstructing long-wavelength density modes, in the spirit of the ""tidal reconstruction"" technique that has been proposed elsewhere, and discuss the dominant biases on this estimator. After applying bias-hardening, we find that a detection of the lensing potential power spectrum will still be challenging for the first phase of SKA-Low, CHIME, and HIRAX, with gravitational nonlinearities decreasing the signal to noise by a factor of a few compared to forecasts that ignore these effects. On the other hand, cross-correlations between lensing and galaxy clustering or cosmic shear from a large photometric survey look promising, provided that systematics can be sufficiently controlled. We reach similar conclusions for a single-dish survey inspired by CII measurements planned for CCAT-prime, suggesting that lensing is an interesting science target not just for 21cm surveys, but also for intensity maps of other lines.

The planetary magnetic fields connect with the stellar radial field over much of the planetary surface, allowing direct flow of stellar wind particles onto the planetary atmosphere.

We investigate the conditions and the structure of the subsonic part of the outflow of Galactic WR stars, in particular of the WNE subclass; our focus is on the conditions at the sonic point. We compute 1D hydrodynamic stellar structure models for massive helium stars adopting outer boundaries at the sonic point. We find that the outflows of our models are accelerated to supersonic velocities by the radiative force from opacity bumps either at temperatures of the order of 200kK by the Fe opacity bump or of the order of 50kK by the HeII opacity bump. For a given mass-loss rate, the conditions in the subsonic part of the outflow are independent from the detailed physical conditions in the supersonic part. The close proximity to the Eddington limit at the sonic point allows us to construct a Sonic HR diagram, relating the sonic point temperature to the L/M ratio and the stellar mass-loss rate, thereby constraining the sonic point conditions, the subsonic structure, and the stellar wind mass-loss rates from observations. The minimum mass-loss rate necessary to have the flow accelerated to supersonic velocities by the Fe opacity bump is derived. A comparison of the observed parameters of Galactic WNE stars to this minimum mass-loss rate indicates that their winds are launched to supersonic velocities by the radiation pressure arising from the Fe-bump. Conversely, models which do not show transonic flows from the Fe opacity bump form inflated envelopes.

There has been much recent interest in gradient-based meta-optimization, where one tunes hyperparameters, or even learns an optimizer, in order to minimize the expected loss when the training procedure is unrolled. But because the training procedure must be unrolled thousands of times, the meta-objective must be defined with an orders-of-magnitude shorter time horizon than is typical for neural net training. We show that such short-horizon meta-objectives cause a serious bias towards small step sizes, an effect we term short-horizon bias. We introduce a toy problem, a noisy quadratic cost function, on which we analyze short-horizon bias by deriving and comparing the optimal schedules for short and long time horizons. We then run meta-optimization experiments (both offline and online) on standard benchmark datasets, showing that meta-optimization chooses too small a learning rate by multiple orders of magnitude, even when run with a moderately long time horizon (100 steps) typical of work in the area. We believe short-horizon bias is a fundamental problem that needs to be addressed if meta-optimization is to scale to practical neural net training regimes.

Now we studied the upper atmospheres under this conditions. Check out our new paper: <LINK>']",https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04617,"Recently, four additional Earth-mass planets were discovered orbiting the nearby ultracool M8 dwarf TRAPPIST-1, making a remarkable total of seven planets with equilibrium temperatures compatible with the presence of liquid water on their surface. Temperate terrestrial planets around an M-dwarf orbit close to their parent star, rendering their atmospheres vulnerable to erosion by the stellar wind and energetic electromagnetic and particle radiation. Here, we use state-of-the-art 3D magnetohydrodynamic models to simulate the wind around TRAPPIST-1 and study the conditions at each planetary orbit. All planets experience a stellar wind pressure between $10^3$ and $10^5$ times the solar wind pressure on Earth. All orbits pass through wind pressure changes of an order of magnitude and most planets spend a large fraction of their orbital period in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime. For plausible planetary magnetic field strengths, all magnetospheres are greatly compressed and undergo much more dynamic change than that of the Earth. The planetary magnetic fields connect with the stellar radial field over much of the planetary surface, allowing direct flow of stellar wind particles onto the planetary atmosphere. These conditions could result in strong atmospheric stripping and evaporation and should be taken into account for any realistic assessment of the evolution and habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.

However, because evolution is an algorithmic process that transcends the substrate in which it occurs, evolution's creativity is not limited to nature. Indeed, many researchers in the field of digital evolution have observed their evolving algorithms and organisms subverting their intentions, exposing unrecognized bugs in their code, producing unexpected adaptations, or exhibiting outcomes uncannily convergent with ones in nature. Such stories routinely reveal creativity by evolution in these digital worlds, but they rarely fit into the standard scientific narrative. Instead they are often treated as mere obstacles to be overcome, rather than results that warrant study in their own right. The stories themselves are traded among researchers through oral tradition, but that mode of information transmission is inefficient and prone to error and outright loss. Moreover, the fact that these stories tend to be shared only among practitioners means that many natural scientists do not realize how interesting and lifelike digital organisms are and how natural their evolution can be. To our knowledge, no collection of such anecdotes has been published before. This paper is the crowd-sourced product of researchers in the fields of artificial life and evolutionary computation who have provided first-hand accounts of such cases. It thus serves as a written, fact-checked collection of scientifically important and even entertaining stories. In doing so we also present here substantial evidence that the existence and importance of evolutionary surprises extends beyond the natural world, and may indeed be a universal property of all complex evolving systems.

Stay tuned for more insights from weak lensing analysis! <LINK> <LINK>']",https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02824,"We use ~100 square deg of deep (>28.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in i-band), high-quality (median 0.6 arcsec seeing) imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey to reveal the halo mass dependence of the surface mass density profiles and outer stellar envelopes of massive galaxies. The i-band images from the HSC survey reach ~4 magnitudes deeper than Sloan Digital Sky Survey and enable us to directly trace stellar mass distributions to 100 kpc without requiring stacking. We conclusively show that, at fixed stellar mass, the stellar profiles of massive galaxies depend on the masses of their dark matter haloes. On average, massive central galaxies with $\log M_{\star, 100\ \mathrm{kpc}}>11.6$ in more massive haloes at 0.3 < z < 0.5 have shallower inner stellar mass density profiles (within ~10-20 kpc) and more prominent outer envelopes. These differences translate into a halo mass dependence of the mass-size relation. Central galaxies in haloes with $\log M_{\rm{Halo}}>14.0$ are ~20% larger in $R_{\mathrm{50}}$ at fixed stellar mass. Such dependence is also reflected in the relationship between the stellar mass within 10 and 100 kpc. Comparing to the mass--size relation, the $\log M_{\star, 100\ \rm{kpc}}$-$\log M_{\star, 10\ \rm{kpc}}$ relation avoids the ambiguity in the definition of size, and can be straightforwardly compared with simulations. Our results demonstrate that, with deep images from HSC, we can quantify the connection between halo mass and the outer stellar halo, which may provide new constraints on the formation and assembly of massive central galaxies.

I’m so excited to share my first paper with @ZivEpstein from #gradschool entitled “Closing the AI Knowledge Gap.” We believe anyone should be able to study #ai . \n\nPreprint: <LINK>'],https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07233,"AI researchers employ not only the scientific method, but also methodology from mathematics and engineering. However, the use of the scientific method - specifically hypothesis testing - in AI is typically conducted in service of engineering objectives. Growing interest in topics such as fairness and algorithmic bias show that engineering-focused questions only comprise a subset of the important questions about AI systems. This results in the AI Knowledge Gap: the number of unique AI systems grows faster than the number of studies that characterize these systems' behavior. To close this gap, we argue that the study of AI could benefit from the greater inclusion of researchers who are well positioned to formulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of AI systems. We examine the barriers preventing social and behavioral scientists from conducting such studies. Our diagnosis suggests that accelerating the scientific study of AI systems requires new incentives for academia and industry, mediated by new tools and institutions. To address these needs, we propose a two-sided marketplace called TuringBox. On one side, AI contributors upload existing and novel algorithms to be studied scientifically by others. On the other side, AI examiners develop and post machine intelligence tasks designed to evaluate and characterize algorithmic behavior. We discuss this market's potential to democratize the scientific study of AI behavior, and thus narrow the AI Knowledge Gap. ",Closing the AI Knowledge Gap

Aiming to counter them, detection techniques based on either static or dynamic analysis that model Android malware, have been proposed. While the pros and cons of these analysis techniques are known, they are usually compared in the context of their limitations e.g., static analysis is not able to capture runtime behaviors, full code coverage is usually not achieved during dynamic analysis, etc. Whereas, in this paper, we analyze the performance of static and dynamic analysis methods in the detection of Android malware and attempt to compare them in terms of their detection performance, using the same modeling approach. To this end, we build on MaMaDroid, a state-of-the-art detection system that relies on static analysis to create a behavioral model from the sequences of abstracted API calls. Then, aiming to apply the same technique in a dynamic analysis setting, we modify CHIMP, a platform recently proposed to crowdsource human inputs for app testing, in order to extract API calls' sequences from the traces produced while executing the app on a CHIMP virtual device. We call this system AuntieDroid and instantiate it by using both automated (Monkey) and user-generated inputs. We find that combining both static and dynamic analysis yields the best performance, with F-measure reaching 0.92. We also show that static analysis is at least as effective as dynamic analysis, depending on how apps are stimulated during execution, and, finally, investigate the reasons for inconsistent misclassifications across methods.
