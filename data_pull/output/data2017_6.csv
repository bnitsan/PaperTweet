Both typical and rare fluctuations of the time averaged momentum flux are needed to fully characterize the slow flow evolution. The fluctuations are described by a large deviation rate function that may be calculated either from numerical simulation, or from theory. We show that, for parameter regimes in which a quasilinear approximation is accurate, the rate function can be found by solving a matrix Riccati equation. Using this tool we compute for the first time the large deviation rate function for the Reynolds stress of a turbulent flow. We study a barotropic flow on a rotating sphere, and show that the fluctuations are highly non-Gaussian. This work opens up new perspectives for the study of rare transitions between attractors in turbulent flows. ","Fluctuations and large deviations of Reynolds stresses in zonal jet

However, some spike-timing-related strengths of SNNs are hindered by the sensitivity of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rules to input spike rates, as fine temporal correlations may be obstructed by coarser correlations between firing rates. In this article, we propose a spike-timing-dependent learning rule that allows a neuron to learn from the temporally-coded information despite the presence of rate codes. Our long-term plasticity rule makes use of short-term synaptic fatigue dynamics. We show analytically that, in contrast to conventional STDP rules, our fatiguing STDP (FSTDP) helps learn the temporal code, and we derive the necessary conditions to optimize the learning process. We showcase the effectiveness of FSTDP in learning spike-timing correlations among processes of different rates in synthetic data. Finally, we use FSTDP to detect correlations in real-world weather data from the United States in an experimental realization of the algorithm that uses a neuromorphic hardware platform comprising phase-change memristive devices. Taken together, our analyses and demonstrations suggest that FSTDP paves the way for the exploitation of the spike-based strengths of SNNs in real-world applications.

A major driver of steady-state plate tectonics on Earth is the sinking of the cold subducting plate into the underlying mantle. This sinking is the result of the combined effects of the thermal contraction of the lithosphere and of metamorphic transitions within the basaltic oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle. The latter of these effects is dependent on the bulk composition of the planet, e.g., the major, terrestrial planet-building elements Mg, Si, Fe, Ca, Al, and Na, which vary in abundance across the Galaxy. We present thermodynamic phase-equilibria calculations of planetary differentiation to calculate both melt composition and mantle mineralogy, and show that a planet's refractory and moderately-volatile elemental abundances control a terrestrial planet's likelihood to produce mantle-derived, melt-extracted crusts that sink. Those planets forming with a higher concentration of Si and Na abundances are less likely to undergo sustained tectonics compared to the Earth. We find only 1/3 of the range of stellar compositions observed in the Galaxy is likely to host planets able to sustain density-driven tectonics compared to the Sun/Earth. Systems outside of this compositional range are less likely to produce planets able to tectonically regulate their climate and may be inhospitable to life as we know it.

We use the 1D radiation hydrodynamics code RADYN to calculate mid-infrared continuum emission from model atmospheres undergoing sudden deposition of energy by non-thermal electrons. We identify and characterise the main continuum thermal emission processes relevant to flare intensity enhancement in the mid- to far-infrared (2-200 $\mu$m) spectral range as free-free emission on neutrals and ions. We find that the infrared intensity evolution tracks the energy input to within a second, albeit with a lingering intensity enhancement, and provides a very direct indication of the evolution of the atmospheric ionization. The prediction of highly impulsive emission means that, on these timescales, the atmospheric hydrodynamics need not be considered in analysing the mid-IR signatures.

In this paper, we compare the standard ""fully supervised"" approach (that relies on knowledge of event-by-event truth-level labels) with a recent proposal that instead utilizes class ratios as the only discriminating information provided during training. This so-called ""weakly supervised"" technique has access to less information than the fully supervised method and yet is still able to yield impressive discriminating power. In addition, weak supervision seems particularly well suited to particle physics since quantum mechanics is incompatible with the notion of mapping an individual event onto any single Feynman diagram. We examine the technique in detail -- both analytically and numerically -- with a focus on the robustness to issues of mischaracterizing the training samples. Weakly supervised networks turn out to be remarkably insensitive to systematic mismodeling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the event level outputs for weakly versus fully supervised networks are probing different kinematics, even though the numerical quality metrics are essentially identical. This implies that it should be possible to improve the overall classification ability by combining the output from the two types of networks. For concreteness, we apply this technology to a signature of beyond the Standard Model physics to demonstrate that all these impressive features continue to hold in a scenario of relevance to the LHC.

In our analysis, we consider 3 different values of the DM mass ($50$ GeV, $300$ GeV, $1$ TeV) and 4 different experimental ensembles, each consisting of at least 3 different targets -- Xe and Ar plus one among the following: Si, Ge, $\mathrm{CaWO_4}$, or Ge/$\mathrm{CaWO_4}$.

In the best case scenario, the discrimination significance can reach $\mathcal{O}(3\sigma)$ for three of the four ensembles considered, and $\mathcal{O}(5\sigma)$ for the ensemble including $\mathrm{Si}$, highlighting the need for a variety of experimental targets in order to determine the DM properties.

Below z~6, the stellar mass function and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function slightly flatten below M_star~10^4.5 M_sun (fainter than M_1500~-12), owing to the fact that star formation in low-mass halos is suppressed by the ionizing background by the end of reionization.

Our result is a first step towards quantifying effects of energy loss as a result of the fluctuation of the multi-parton jet substructure and therefore goes beyond the standard approach to jet quenching based on single parton energy loss. We briefly discuss applications to jet observables in heavy-ion collisions. ",Radiative energy loss of neighboring subjets

These planets reside on ~9 day orbits around host stars which recently evolved into red giants. We constrain the irradiation history of these planets using models constrained by asteroseismology and Keck/HIRES spectroscopy and radial velocity measurements. We measure planet radii of 1.31 +\- 0.11 Rjup and and 1.30 +\- 0.07 Rjup, respectively. These radii are typical for planets receiving the current irradiation, but not the former, zero age main sequence irradiation of these planets. This suggests that the current sizes of these planets are directly correlated to their current irradiation. Our precise constraints of the masses and radii of the stars and planets in these systems allow us to constrain the planetary heating efficiency of both systems as 0.03% +0.03%/-0.02%. These results are consistent with a planet re-inflation scenario, but suggest the efficiency of planet re-inflation may be lower than previously theorized. Finally, we discuss the agreement within 10% of stellar masses and radii, and planet masses, radii, and orbital periods of both systems and speculate that this may be due to selection bias in searching for planets around evolved stars.

We disagree to some extent with the nucleosynthetic results of previous work on sub-Chandrasekhar-mass bare C/O WD detonations; e.g., we find that a median-brightness SN Ia is produced by the detonation of a 1.0 Msol WD instead of a more massive and rarer 1.1 Msol WD. The neutron-rich nucleosynthesis in our simulations agrees broadly with some observational constraints, although tensions remain with others. There are also discrepancies related to the velocities of the outer ejecta and light curve shapes, but overall our synthetic light curves and spectra are roughly consistent with observations. We are hopeful that future multi-dimensional simulations will resolve these issues and further bolster the dynamically-driven double degenerate double detonation scenario's potential to explain most SNe Ia.

Then, using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational questions, but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs.

Recently, there have been detections of spiral features in young, embedded objects that appear consistent with GI-driven structure. It is crucial to perform hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of gravitationally unstable discs in order to assess the validity of GIs in such objects, and constrain optimal targets for future observations. We utilise the radiative transfer code LIME to produce continuum emission maps of a $0.17\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ self-gravitating protosolar-like disc. We note the limitations of using LIME as is and explore methods to improve upon the default gridding. We use CASA to produce synthetic observations of 270 continuum emission maps generated across different frequencies, inclinations and dust opacities. We find that the spiral structure of our protosolar-like disc model is distinguishable across the majority of our parameter space after 1 hour of observation, and is especially prominent at 230$\,$GHz due to the favourable combination of angular resolution and sensitivity. Disc mass derived from the observations is sensitive to the assumed dust opacities and temperatures, and therefore can be underestimated by a factor of at least 30 at 850$\,$GHz and 2.5 at 90$\,$GHz. As a result, this effect could retrospectively validate GIs in discs previously thought not massive enough to be gravitationally unstable, which could have a significant impact on the understanding of the formation and evolution of protoplanetary discs.

We find the stellar masses of the galaxies formed in Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) with $\sigma/m= 1\, cm^2/g$ are very similar to those in CDM (spanning $M_{\star} \approx 10^{5.7 - 7.0} M_{\odot}$) and all runs lie on a similar stellar mass -- size relation. The logarithmic dark matter density slope ($\alpha=d\log \rho / d\log r$) in the central $250-500$ pc remains steeper than $\alpha= -0.8$ for the CDM-Hydro simulations with stellar mass $M_{\star} \sim 10^{6.6} M_{\odot}$ and core-like in the most massive galaxy. In contrast, every SIDM hydrodynamic simulation yields a flatter profile, with $\alpha >-0.4$. Moreover, the central density profiles predicted in SIDM runs without baryons are similar to the SIDM runs that include FIRE-2 baryonic physics. Thus, SIDM appears to be much more robust to the inclusion of (potentially uncertain) baryonic physics than CDM on this mass scale, suggesting SIDM will be easier to falsify than CDM using low-mass galaxies. Our FIRE simulations predict that galaxies less massive than $M_{\star} < 3 \times 10^6 M_{\odot}$ provide potentially ideal targets for discriminating models, with SIDM producing substantial cores in such tiny galaxies and CDM producing cusps.

Although many theories have been forwarded as to how development can aid evolution, it is difficult to isolate each such proposed mechanism. Thus, here we introduce a minimal yet embodied model of development: the body of the robot changes over its lifetime, yet growth is not influenced by the environment. We show that even this simple developmental model confers evolvability because it allows evolution to sweep over a larger range of body plans than an equivalent non-developmental system, and subsequent heterochronic mutations 'lock in' this body plan in more morphologically-static descendants.
