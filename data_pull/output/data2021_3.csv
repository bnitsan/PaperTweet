To plan effectively, robots must be able to respond to and sometimes influence what humans do. This requires a human model which predicts future human actions. A simple model may assume the human will continue what they did previously; a more complex one might predict that the human will act optimally, disregarding the robot; whereas an even more complex one might capture the robot's ability to influence the human. These models make different trade-offs between computational time and performance of the resulting robot plan. Using only one model of the human either wastes computational resources or is unable to handle critical situations. In this work, we give the robot access to a suite of human models and enable it to assess the performance-computation trade-off online. By estimating how an alternate model could improve human prediction and how that may translate to performance gain, the robot can dynamically switch human models whenever the additional computation is justified. Our experiments in a driving simulator showcase how the robot can achieve performance comparable to always using the best human model, but with greatly reduced computation.

In particular: stability or stablizability in the Koopman framework implies the existence of a contraction metric (resp. control contraction metric) for the nonlinear system. Further in certain cases the converse holds: contraction implies the existence of a set of observables with which stability can be verified via the Koopman framework. We provide results for the cases of autonomous and time-varying systems, as well as orbital stability of limit cycles. Furthermore, the converse claims are based on a novel relation between the Koopman method and construction of a Kazantzis-Kravaris-Luenberger observer.

Being able to accurately evaluate and select high-performing policies without requiring online interaction could yield significant benefits in safety, time, and cost for these applications. While many OPE methods have been proposed in recent years, comparing results between papers is difficult because currently there is a lack of a comprehensive and unified benchmark, and measuring algorithmic progress has been challenging due to the lack of difficult evaluation tasks. In order to address this gap, we present a collection of policies that in conjunction with existing offline datasets can be used for benchmarking off-policy evaluation. Our tasks include a range of challenging high-dimensional continuous control problems, with wide selections of datasets and policies for performing policy selection. The goal of our benchmark is to provide a standardized measure of progress that is motivated from a set of principles designed to challenge and test the limits of existing OPE methods.

One common practice is to train the model on both labeled source-domain data and unlabeled target-domain data. Yet the learned models are usually biased due to the strong supervision of the source domain. Most researchers adopt the early-stopping strategy to prevent over-fitting, but when to stop training remains a challenging problem since the lack of the target-domain validation set. In this paper, we propose one efficient bootstrapping method, called Adaboost Student, explicitly learning complementary models during training and liberating users from empirical early stopping. Adaboost Student combines the deep model learning with the conventional training strategy, i.e., adaptive boosting, and enables interactions between learned models and the data sampler. We adopt one adaptive data sampler to progressively facilitate learning on hard samples and aggregate ""weak"" models to prevent over-fitting. Extensive experiments show that (1) Without the need to worry about the stopping time, AdaBoost Student provides one robust solution by efficient complementary model learning during training.

In this paper, we propose a new generative approach for highly transferable targeted perturbations (\ours). We note that the existing methods are less suitable for this task due to their reliance on class-boundary information that changes from one model to another, thus reducing transferability. In contrast, our approach matches the perturbed image `distribution' with that of the target class, leading to high targeted transferability rates. To this end, we propose a new objective function that not only aligns the global distributions of source and target images, but also matches the local neighbourhood structure between the two domains. Based on the proposed objective, we train a generator function that can adaptively synthesize perturbations specific to a given input. Our generative approach is independent of the source or target domain labels, while consistently performs well against state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of attack settings.

Additional sub-types show no rotational variability suggesting a uniform distribution of reflective elements on the floofy object. While the work here is a promising step towards the categorization of floofy objects, further observations with more strictly defined limits on background light, illumination angles, and companion objects are necessary to develop a better understanding of the many remaining mysteries of these astronomical objects.

Here we show, for the first time, how Swift's lyrical and melodic structure have evolved in their representation of emotions over a timescale of $\tau\sim14$ yr. Previous progress on this topic has been challenging based on the sheer volume of the relevant discography, and that uniquely identifying a song that optimally describes a hypothetical emotional state represents a multi-dimensional and complex task. To quantify the emotional state of a song, we separate the criteria into the level of optimism ($H$) and the strength of commitment to a relationship ($R$), based on lyrics and chordal tones. We apply these criteria to a set of 149 pieces spanning almost the entire repertoire. We find an overall trend toward positive emotions in stronger relationships, with a best-fit linear relationship of $R=0.642^{+0.086}_{-0.053}H-1.74^{+0.39}_{-0.29}$. We find no significant trends in mean happiness ($H$) within individual albums over time. The mean relationship score ($R$) shows trends which we speculate may be due to age and the global pandemic. We provide tentative indications that partners with blue eyes and/or bad reputations may lead to overall less positive emotions, while those with green or indigo-colored eyes may produce more positive emotions and stronger relationships. However, we stress that these trends are based on small sample sizes, and more data are necessary to validate them.

Depending on the fraction of BBH arising from AGNs, counterpart searches of $\mathcal{O}(1)-\mathcal{O}(100)$ GW events are needed to establish a confident association, and more than an order of magnitude more for searches without followup (i.e, using only the locations of AGNs and GW events).

Our formalism allows us to jointly infer cosmological parameters from a sample of BBH events that include chance coincidence flares.

This can yield a theory with second order field equations similar to those found in other popular modified gravity models. Using a more general setting the theory gives fourth order equations. This model is based on the metric alone and does not require more general geometries. It is possible to show that our new theory and the recently proposed $f(Q)$ gravity models are equivalent at the level of the action and at the level of the field equations, provided that appropriate boundary terms are taken into account. Our theory can also match up with $f(R)$ gravity which is an expected result. Perhaps more surprisingly, we can also show that this equivalence extends to $f(T)$ gravity at the level of the action and its field equations, provided that appropriate boundary terms are taken in account. While these three theories are conceptually different and are based on different geometrical settings, we can establish the necessary conditions under which their field equations are indistinguishable. The final part requires matter to couple minimally to gravity. Through this work we emphasise the importance played by boundary terms which are at the heart of our approach.

In this work, we consider a simplified model for fermionic (Majorana) DM and study the circularly polarised gamma rays below 10 GeV from the scattering of cosmic ray electrons on DM. We calculate the differential flux of positive and negative polarised photons from the Galactic Center and show that the degree of circular polarization can reach up to 90%. Finally, once collider and DM constraints have been taken into account, we estimate the required sensitivity from future experiments to detect this signal finding that, although a distinctive peak will be present in the photon flux spectrum, a near future observation is unlikely.

There are few methods of showing directly strong locality of a quantum field. Among them, linear energy bounds are the most widely used, yet a chiral conformal field of conformal weight $d>2$ cannot admit linear energy bounds. In this paper we give a new direct method to prove strong locality in two-dimensional conformal field theory. We prove that if a chiral conformal field satisfies an energy bound of degree $d-1$, then it also satisfies a certain local version of the energy bound, and this in turn implies strong locality. A central role in our proof is played by diffeomorphism symmetry. As a concrete application, we show that the vertex operator algebra given by a unitary vacuum representation of the $\mathcal{W}_3$-algebra is strongly local. For central charge $c > 2$, this yields a new conformal net. We further prove that these nets do not satisfy strong additivity, and hence are not completely rational.

We develop and estimate a theoretical model of risky choices and mental health, in which mental health disparity across groups is generated by different degrees of self-control problems.

Their effects on the redshift-distance conversion are hence usually ignored. Any deviation from this consensus can strongly bias the results of such studies and thus the importance of testing these assumptions cannot be understated. Scaling relations of galaxy clusters can be effectively used for that. In previous works, we observed strong anisotropies in cluster scaling relations, whose origins remain ambiguous. By measuring many different cluster properties, several scaling relations with different sensitivities can be built. Nearly independent tests of cosmic isotropy and bulk flows are then feasible. We make use of up to 570 clusters with measured properties at X-ray, microwave, and infrared wavelengths, to construct 10 different cluster scaling relations (five of them presented for the first time) and test the isotropy of the local Universe.

To estimate the locations of these plasma regions from the central black hole we compare distance methods, excluding the variability arguments as there is no spectral change between observations. Although the methods are unable to constrain the distances, the locations are consistent with the narrow line region, with the possibility of the higher ionised component being part of the broad line region, but we cannot conclude this for certain. In addition, we find evidence for emission from collisionally ionised plasma, while previous analysis had suggested that collisional plasma emission was unlikely.

This paper attempts to explore whether the number of journals published from a country influences its research output. Scopus master journal list is analysed to identify journals published from 50 selected countries with significant volume of research output. The following relationship are analysed: (a) number of journals from a country and its research output, (b) growth rate of journals and research output for different countries, (c) global share of journals and research output for different countries, and (d) subject area-wise number of journals and research output in that subject area for different countries. Factors like journal packing density are also analysed. The results obtained show that for majority of the countries, the number of journals is positively correlated to their research output volume, though some other factors also play a role in growth of research output.

We use PSP velocity and magnetic field measurements from 24 h intervals selected from each of the first four encounters. The applicability of TH is investigated by measuring the parameter $\epsilon=\delta u_0/\sqrt{2}V_\perp$, which quantifies the ratio between the typical speed of large-scale fluctuations, $\delta u_0$, and the local perpendicular PSP speed in the solar wind frame, $V_\perp$. TH is expected to be applicable for $\epsilon\lesssim0.5$ when PSP is moving nearly perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the plasma frame, irrespective of the Alfv\'en Mach number $M_{\rm A}=V_{\rm SW}/V_{\rm A}$, where $V_{\rm SW}$ and $V_{\rm A}$ are the local solar wind and Alfv\'en speed, respectively. For the four selected solar wind intervals we find that between 10% to 60% of the time the parameter $\epsilon$ is below 0.2 when the sampling angle (between the spacecraft velocity in the plasma frame and the local magnetic field) is greater than $30^\circ$. For angles above $30^\circ$, the sampling direction is sufficiently oblique to allow one to reconstruct the reduced energy spectrum $E(k_\perp)$ of magnetic fluctuations from its measured frequency spectra. The spectral indices determined from power-law fits of the measured frequency spectrum accurately represent the spectral indices associated with the underlying spatial spectrum of turbulent fluctuations in the plasma frame. Aside from a frequency broadening due to large-scale sweeping that requires careful consideration, the spatial spectrum can be recovered to obtain the distribution of fluctuation's energy among scales in the plasma frame.

However, its pulse-averaged flux density increased significantly by about 10 per cent in the post-glitch epoch and decayed slightly before our fourth observation a day later. We show that the increase was unlikely caused by calibration issues. While we cannot exclude that it was due to refractive interstellar scintillation, it is hard to reconcile with refractive effects. The chance coincidence probability of the flux density increase and the glitch event is low. Finally, we present the evolution of the pulsar's pulse profile across the band.

The resulting optimization problem, which is convex, allows for various regularizations and constraints to be imposed on the generating function. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for our optimization problem and provide a stability estimate in terms of a Wasserstein metric of the input measure. Then, we formulate a discretization which can be implemented numerically using available software packages and analyze its approximation error. Finally, we present empirical examples using CRSP data from the US stock market, including the performance of the portfolios allowing for dividends, defaults, and transaction costs.

This paper derives a novel nadir constraint from the swing equation that, for the first time, provides a framework for the optimal comparison of all these services. We demonstrate that this constraint can be accurately and conservatively approximated for moderate UFLS levels with a second order cone, resulting in highly tractable convex problems.

XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification), or through deletion/insertion techniques.

Also, benchmark datasets for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a long benchmark dataset and train a fully-connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated attribution heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly.

Due to temporal and chromatic evolution of a telescope's PSF, the best correlated reference images are usually the most contaminated by the planet, leading to self-subtraction and reducing the planet throughput. In this paper, we present an algorithm that directly optimizes the non-linear equation for planet signal to noise ratio (SNR). This new algorithm does not require us to reject adjacent reference images and optimally balances noise reduction with self-subtraction. We then show how this algorithm can be applied to multiple images simultaneously for a further reduction in correlated noise, directly maximizing the SNR of the final combined image. Finally, we demonstrate the technique on an illustrative sequence of HR8799 using the new Julia-based Signal to Noise Analysis Pipeline (SNAP). We show that SNR optimization can provide up to a $5\times$ improvement in contrast close to the star. Applicable to both new and archival data, this technique will allow for the detection of lower mass, and closer in companions, or achieve the same sensitivity with less telescope time.

We present the results of an independent method to constrain the product of the UVB photoionisation rate and the covering fraction of Lyman limit systems (LLSs) by searching for the fluorescent Lyman-$\alpha$ emission produced by self-shielded clouds. Because the expected surface brightness is well below current sensitivity limits for direct imaging, we developed a new method based on three-dimensional stacking of the IGM around Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) between 2.9<z<6.6 using deep MUSE observations. Combining our results with covering fractions of LLSs obtained from mock cubes extracted from the EAGLE simulation, we obtain new and independent constraints on the UVB at z>3 that are consistent with previous measurements, with a preference for relatively low UVB intensities at z=3, and which suggest a non-monotonic decrease of $\Gamma$HI with increasing redshift between 3<z<5. This could suggest a possible tension between some UVB models and current observations which however require deeper and wider observations in Lyman-$\alpha$ emission and absorption to be confirmed.

Combining these data with additional radio observations from the GMRT and the JVLA, we find a variety of radio spectral shapes and luminosities within our sample despite their similarly bright submillimetre flux densities. We characterise their spectral shapes in terms of multi-band radio spectral indices. Finding strong spectral flattening at low frequencies in ~20% of sources, we investigate the differences between sources with extremely flat low-frequency spectra and those with `normal' radio spectral indices. As there are no other statistically significant differences between the two subgroups of our sample as split by the radio spectral index, we suggest that any differences are undetectable in galaxy-averaged properties that we can observe with our unresolved images, and likely relate to galaxy properties that we cannot resolve, on scales $\lesssim$ 1 kpc. We attribute the observed spectral flattening in the radio to free-free absorption, proposing that those sources with significant low-frequency spectral flattening have a clumpy distribution of star-forming gas. We estimate an average spatial extent of absorbing material of at most several hundred parsecs to produce the levels of absorption observed in the radio spectra. This estimate is consistent with the highest-resolution observations of submillimetre galaxies in the literature, which find examples of non-uniform dust distributions on scales of ~100 pc, with evidence for clumps and knots in the interstellar medium.

We test whether or not such dust around gas gaps opened by planets can remain settled by performing three-dimensional, dust-plus-gas simulations of protoplanetary disks with an embedded planet. We find planets massive enough to open gas gaps stir small, sub-mm-sized dust grains to high disk elevations at the gap edges, where the dust scale-height can reach ~70% of the gas scale-height. We attribute this dust 'puff-up' to the planet-induced meridional gas flows previously identified by Fung & Chiang and others. We thus emphasize the importance of explicit 3D simulations to obtain the vertical distribution of sub-mm-sized grains around gas gaps opened by massive planets.

We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations.

In contrast, the calculated masses of CO2 at lower rock strengths are systematically smaller than the experimental values. Our results require a reassessment of the interpretation of thermal metamorphism in meteorites. ","The role of post-shock heating by plastic deformation during impact

Our approach is to construct an analytic model of the multipoles of the correlation function and their covariance matrix that includes foreground contamination and beam resolution effects, which we then use to generate an ensemble of mock data vectors from which we attempt to recover the BAO scale. In line with previous studies, we find that recovery of the transverse BAO scale $\alpha_{\perp}$ is hampered by the strong smoothing effect of the instrumental beam with increasing redshift, while the radial scale $\alpha_\parallel$ is much more robust. The multipole formalism naturally incorporates transverse information when it is available however, and so there is no need to perform a radial-only analysis. In particular, the quadrupole of the correlation function preserves a distinctive BAO `bump' feature even for large smoothing scales. We also investigate the robustness of BAO scale recovery to beam model accuracy, severity of the foreground removal cuts, and accuracy of the covariance matrix model, finding in all cases that the radial BAO scale can be recovered in an accurate, unbiased manner.

The ambient density traced by the outflow declines as $\approx R^{-1.6}$ on a scale of $\approx (1-4)\times 10^{16}$ cm ($\approx 6300-25000$ $R_s$), followed by a steeper decline to $\approx 6\times 10^{16}$ cm ($\approx 37500$ $R_s$). Allowing for a collimated geometry, we find that to reach even mildly relativistic velocities ($\Gamma=2$) the outflow requires an opening angle of $\theta_j\approx 2^\circ$, which is narrow even by the standards of GRB jets; a truly relativistic outflow requires an unphysically narrow jet. The outflow velocity and kinetic energy in AT2019dsg are typical of previous non-relativistic TDEs, and comparable to those from Type Ib/c supernovae, raising doubts about the claimed association with a high-energy neutrino event.

Such a reprocessing model would be characterised by lags between X-ray and optical/UV emission due to differences in light travel time. Observationally however, such lag features have been difficult to detect due to gaps in the lightcurves introduced through factors such as source visibility or limited telescope time. In this work, Gaussian process regression is employed to interpolate the gaps in the Swift X-ray and UV lightcurves of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 335. In a simulation study of five commonly-employed analytic Gaussian process kernels, we conclude that the Matern 1/2 and rational quadratic kernels yield the most well-specified models for the X-ray and UVW2 bands of Mrk 335. In analysing the structure functions of the Gaussian process lightcurves, we obtain a broken power law with a break point at 125 days in the UVW2 band. In the X-ray band, the structure function of the Gaussian process lightcurve is consistent with a power law in the case of the rational quadratic kernel whilst a broken power law with a breakpoint at 66 days is obtained from the Matern 1/2 kernel. The subsequent cross-correlation analysis is consistent with previous studies and furthermore, shows tentative evidence for a broad X-ray-UV lag feature of up to 30 days in the lag-frequency spectrum where the significance of the lag depends on the choice of Gaussian process kernel.

Here we examine ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray data obtained when EXO 0748-676, a crust-cooling source, was in quiescence. Our Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy observations do not detect the far-UV continuum emission, but do reveal one strong emission line, Civ. The line is relatively broad (>3500 km/s), which could indicate that it results from an outflow such as a pulsar wind. By studying several epochs of X-ray and near-UV data obtained with XMM-Newton, we find no clear indication that the emission in the two wavebands is connected. Moreover, the luminosity ratio of Lx/Luv >100 is much higher than that observed from neutron star LMXBs that exhibit low-level accretion in quiescence. Taken together, this suggests that the UV and X-ray emission of EXO 0748-676 may have different origins, and that thermal emission from crust-cooling of the neutron star, rather than ongoing low-level accretion, may be dominating the observed quiescent X-ray flux evolution of this LMXB.

Dannen et al. recently discovered that under these circumstances, thermally driven wind solutions are unsteady and even show very dense clumps due to thermal instability. To explore the observational consequences of these new wind solutions, we compute line profiles based on the one-dimensional simulations of Dannen et al. We show how the line profiles from even a simple steady state wind solution depend on the ionization energy (IE) of absorbing ions, which is a reflection of the wind ionization stratification. To organize the diversity of the line shapes, we group them into four categories: weak Gaussians, saturated boxy profiles with and without an extended blue wing, and broad weak profiles. The lines with profiles in the last two categories are produced by ions with the highest IE that probe the fastest regions. Their maximum blueshifts agree with the highest flow velocities in thermally unstable models, both steady state and clumpy versions. In contrast, the maximum blueshifts of the most high IE lines in thermally stable models can be less than half of the actual solution velocities.

Here, we collect a sample of 15 protoplanetary disks showing substructures in SPHERE scattered light images and present a homogeneous derivation of planet detection limits in these systems. We also estimate the mass of these perturbers through a Hill radius prescription and a comparison to ALMA data. Assuming that one single planet carves each substructure in scattered light, we find that more massive perturbers are needed to create gaps within cavities than rings, and that we might be close to a detection in the cavities of RX J1604, RX J1615, Sz Cha, HD 135344B and HD 34282.

We propose a causal reduction method that, given a causal model, replaces an arbitrary number of possibly high-dimensional latent confounders with a single latent confounder that takes values in the same space as the treatment variable, without changing the observational and interventional distributions the causal model entails. This allows us to estimate the causal effect in a principled way from combined data without relying on the common but often unrealistic assumption that all confounders have been observed. We apply our causal reduction in three different settings. In the first setting, we assume the treatment and outcome to be discrete. The causal reduction then implies bounds between the observational and interventional distributions that can be exploited for estimation purposes. In certain cases with highly unbalanced observational samples, the accuracy of the causal effect estimate can be improved by incorporating observational data. Second, for continuous variables and assuming a linear-Gaussian model, we derive equality constraints for the parameters of the observational and interventional distributions. Third, for the general continuous setting (possibly nonlinear or non-Gaussian), we parameterize the reduced causal model using normalizing flows, a flexible class of easily invertible nonlinear transformations. We perform a series of experiments on synthetic data and find that in several cases the number of interventional samples can be reduced when adding observational training samples without sacrificing accuracy.

In order to keep up with the quantity and quality of observational datasets, improved prescriptions for galactic chemical evolution need to be incorporated into the simulations. Here we present a new, flexible, time resolved chemical enrichment model for cosmological simulations. Our model allows to easily change a number of stellar physics parameters such as the shape of the initial mass function (IMF), stellar lifetimes, chemical yields or SN Ia delay times. We implement our model into the Gasoline2 code and perform a series of cosmological simulations varying a number of key parameters, foremost evaluating different stellar yield sets for massive stars from the literature. We find that total metallicity, total iron abundance and gas phase oxygen abundance are robust predictions from different yield sets and in agreement with observational relations. On the other hand, individual element abundances, especially $\alpha$-elements show significant differences across different yield sets and none of our models can simultaneously match constraints on the dwarf and MW mass scale. This offers a unique way of observationally constraining model parameters.

These population distributions share some latent structure, so it is advantageous to jointly analyze the samples. One effective way to connect the distributions is the semiparametric density ratio model (DRM). A key ingredient in the DRM is that the log density ratios are linear combinations of prespecified functions; the vector formed by these functions is called the basis function. A sensible basis function can often be chosen based on knowledge of the context, and DRM-based inference is effective even if the basis function is imperfect. However, a data-adaptive approach to the choice of basis function remains an interesting and important research problem. We propose an approach based on the classical functional principal component analysis (FPCA). Under some conditions, we show that this approach leads to consistent basis function estimation. Our simulation results show that the proposed adaptive choice leads to an efficiency gain. We use a real-data example to demonstrate the efficiency gain and the ease of our approach.

Here, influenced by biological systems that robustly navigate spacetime scales even without vision, we develop a joint visual and positional representation learning technique, via a sequential process, and design a learning-based CNN+LSTM architecture, trainable via backpropagation through time, for viewpoint- and appearance-invariant place recognition. Our approach, Sequential Place Learning (SPL), is based on a CNN function that visually encodes an environment from a single traversal, thus reducing storage capacity, while an LSTM temporally fuses each visual embedding with corresponding positional data -- obtained from any source of motion estimation -- for direct sequential inference. Contrary to classical two-stage pipelines, e.g., match-then-temporally-filter, our network directly eliminates false-positive rates while jointly learning sequence matching from a single monocular image sequence, even using short TWs.

Despite a surge of interest in lifelong RL in recent years, the lack of a realistic testbed makes robust evaluation of LLL algorithms difficult. Multi-agent RL (MARL), on the other hand, can be seen as a natural scenario for lifelong RL due to its inherent non-stationarity, since the agents' policies change over time. In this work, we introduce a multi-agent lifelong learning testbed that supports both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

To reduce the computational overhead of gradient updates in CNNs, we freeze the lower layers of CNN encoders early in training due to early convergence of their parameters. Additionally, we reduce memory requirements by storing the low-dimensional latent vectors for experience replay instead of high-dimensional images, enabling an adaptive increase in the replay buffer capacity, a useful technique in constrained-memory settings.

If a proposed plan is an extreme outlier compared to the ensemble with regard to various redistricting criteria, this may indicate that the plan was deliberately engineered to produce a specific outcome. Many methods have been used to construct ensembles, and a fundamental question that arises is: Given a method for constructing plans, can we identify a probability distribution on the space of plans that describes the probability of constructing any particular plan by that method? Recently, MCMC methods have become a predominant tool for constructing ensembles. Here we focus on the MCMC method known as ""ReCom,"" which was introduced in 2018 by the MGGG Redistricting Lab. ReCom tends to produce plans with more compact districts than some other methods, and we sought to better understand this phenomenon. We adopted a discrete analog of district perimeter called ""cut edges"" as a quantitative measure for district compactness; this measure was proposed by Duchin and Tenner, and it avoids some of the difficulties associated with compactness measures based on geographic perimeter, such as the Polsby-Popper score. To model the basic ReCom step, we constructed ensembles of 2-district plans for two grid graphs and for the precinct graph of Boulder County, CO. We found that the probability of sampling any particular plan -- which is roughly proportional to the product of the numbers of spanning trees for each of the two districts -- is also approximately proportional to an exponentially decaying function of the number of cut edges in the plan. This is an important step towards understanding compactness properties for districting plans produced by the ReCom method. ",Compactness statistics for spanning tree recombination

The total radiated energy is large, $E_{\rm rad}\approx 2.5\times 10^{50}$ erg. Despite its large luminosity, approaching those of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), SN\,2019stc exhibits a typical SN Ic spectrum, bridging the gap between SLSNe and SNe Ic.

Instead, if we model the first peak with a combined magnetar spin-down and radioactive heating model we find a better match with $M_{\rm ej}\approx 4$ M$_\odot$, a magnetar spin period of $P_{\rm spin}\approx 7.2$ ms and magnetic field of $B\approx 10^{14}$ G, and $f_{\rm Ni}\lesssim 0.2$ (consistent with SNe Ic). The prominent second peak cannot be naturally accommodated with radioactive heating or magnetar spin-down, but instead can be explained as circumstellar interaction with $\approx 0.7$ $M_\odot$ of hydrogen-free material located $\approx 400$ AU from the progenitor. Including the remnant mass leads to a CO core mass prior to explosion of $\approx 6.5$ M$_\odot$.

The simultaneous presence of these stars can only be explained by stellar models if the cluster has a finely-tuned age of 4-5Myr, with several published studies independently claiming ages within this range. At this age, stellar models predict that the cool supergiants (CSGs) should have luminosities of $\log(L/L_\odot) \approx 5.5$, close to the empirical luminosity limit. Here, we test that prediction using archival data and new photometry from SOFIA to estimate bolometric luminosities for the CSGs. We find that these stars are on average 0.4dex too faint to be 5Myr old, regardless of which stellar evolution model is used, and instead are indicative of a much older age of $10.4^{+1.3}_{-1.2}$Myr. We argue that neither systematic uncertainties in the extinction law nor stellar variability can explain this discrepancy. In reviewing various independent age estimates of Wd1 in the literature, we firstly show that those based on stellar diversity are unreliable. Secondly, we re-analyse Wd1's pre-MS stars employing the Damineli extinction law, finding an age of $7.2^{+1.1}_{-2.3}$Myr; older than that of previous studies, but which is vulnerable to systematic errors that could push the age close to 10Myr. However, there remains significant tension between the CSG age and that inferred from the eclipsing binary W13. We conclude that stellar evolution models cannot explain Wd1 under the single age paradigm. Instead, we propose that the stars in the Wd1 region formed over a period of several Myr.

We therefore obtain an unconditional solution to Hilbert's 12th problem for totally real fields, albeit one that involves $p$-adic integration, for infinitely many primes $p$. Our method of proof of the integral Gross-Stark conjecture is a generalization of our previous work on the Brumer-Stark conjecture. We apply Ribet's method in the context of group ring valued Hilbert modular forms. A key new construction here is the definition of a Galois module $\nabla_{\!\mathscr{L}}$ that incorporates an integral version of the Greenberg-Stevens $\mathscr{L}$-invariant into the theory of Ritter-Weiss modules. This allows for the reinterpretation of Gross's conjecture as the vanishing of the Fitting ideal of $\nabla_{\!\mathscr{L}}$. This vanishing is obtained by constructing a quotient of $\nabla_{\!\mathscr{L}}$ whose Fitting ideal vanishes using the Galois representations associated to cuspidal Hilbert modular forms.

While DEFIPOSER-ARB focuses on DeFi transactions that form a cycle and performs very well for arbitrage, DEFIPOSER-SMT can detect more complicated profitable transactions.

We develop a technique based on Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to mathematically constrain the spherical harmonics to yield a non-negative distribution, making them optimal for expanding the gravitational-wave power and amenable to Bayesian inference. We demonstrate these techniques using a series of simulations and analyses, including recovery of simulated distributed and localized sources of gravitational-wave power. We also apply this method to map the gravitational-wave foreground from galactic white-dwarfs using a simplified model of the galactic white dwarf distribution.

On harder tasks such as object detection and instance segmentation, our simple local self-attention and convolutional hybrids show improvements over very strong baselines.

The young measured age of $1-4$Myr for this system allows us to place strict time constraints on the formation histories of the observed planets. Hence we may be able to make a crucial distinction between formation through core accretion (CA) or the gravitational instability (GI), as CA formation timescales are typically Myrs whilst formation through GI will occur within the first $\approx10^4-10^5$yrs of disc evolution. We focus our analysis on the $4-13$M$_{\rm Jup}$ planet observed at $R\approx30$AU. We find CA formation timescales for such a massive planet typically exceed the system's age. The planet's high mass and wide orbit may instead be indicative of formation through GI. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to determine the system's critical disc mass for fragmentation, finding $M_{\rm d,crit}=0.3$M$_{\odot}$. Viscous evolution models of the disc's mass history indicate that it was likely massive enough to exceed $M_{\rm d,crit}$ in the recent past, thus it is possible that a young AB Aurigae disc may have fragmented to form multiple giant gaseous protoplanets. Calculations of the Jeans mass in an AB Aurigae-like disc find that fragments may initially form with masses $1.6-13.3$M$_{\rm Jup}$, consistent with the planets which have been observed. We therefore propose that the inferred planets in the disc surrounding AB Aurigae may be evidence of planet formation through GI. ","AB Aurigae: Possible evidence of planet formation through the

Out of the three, RL is the least studied and it is still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark tasks. In this work, we introduce a training method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) that can be used to solve RL tasks for discrete and continuous state spaces based on the deep Q-learning algorithm. We investigate which architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents' success in a RL setting than the number of parameters used in the model. Finally, we show when recent separation results between classical and quantum agents for policy gradient RL can be extended to inferring optimal Q-values in restricted families of environments.

It is usually achieved by providing explanations of the system's behavior. A prominent and intuitive type of explanations are counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations explain a behavior to the user by proposing actions -- as changes to the input -- that would cause a different (specified) behavior of the system. However, such explanation methods can be unstable with respect to small changes to the input -- i.e. even a small change in the input can lead to huge or arbitrary changes in the output and of the explanation. This could be problematic for counterfactual explanations, as two similar individuals might get very different explanations. Even worse, if the recommended actions differ considerably in their complexity, one would consider such unstable (counterfactual) explanations as individually unfair. In this work, we formally and empirically study the robustness of counterfactual explanations in general, as well as under different models and different kinds of perturbations.

The latter scales exponentially with the population size. When members of each species migrate into the population at rate $\lambda$ and replace a randomly selected individual, surprisingly rich dynamics ensues. Ostensibly, the population reaches a steady state, but the steady-state population distribution undergoes a unimodal to trimodal transition as the migration rate decreases below a critical value $\lambda_c$. In the low-migration regime, $\lambda<\lambda_c$, the steady state is not truly steady, but instead strongly fluctuates between near-fixation states, where the population consists of mostly A's or of mostly B's.

We develop a force Langevin (FL) model that treats neighbor-induced drag fluctuations as a stochastic force within an EL framework. The stochastic drag force follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and requires closure of the integral time scale for the fluctuating hydrodynamic force and the standard deviation in drag. The former is closed using the mean-free time between successive collisions, derived from the kinetic theory of non-uniform gases. For the latter, particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PR--DNS) of fixed particle assemblies is utilized to develop a correlation. The stochastic EL framework specifies unresolved drag force statistics, leading to the correct evolution and sustainment of particle velocity variance over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and solids volume fractions when compared to PR--DNS of freely-evolving homogeneous suspensions. By contrast, standard EL infers drag statistics from variations in the resolved flow and thus under-predicts the growth and steady particle velocity variance in homogeneous suspensions. Velocity statistics from standard EL approaches are found to depend on the bandwidth of the projection function used for two-way momentum coupling, while results obtained from the stochastic EL approach are insensitive to the projection bandwidth.

It is common to aim to maximize the mean outcome in the population, via a regime assigning treatment only to those whose mean outcome is higher under treatment versus control. However, the mean can be an unstable measure of centrality, resulting in imprecise statistical procedures, as well as unrobust decisions that can be overly influenced by a small fraction of subjects. In this work, we propose a new median optimal treatment regime that instead treats individuals whose conditional median is higher under treatment. This ensures that optimal decisions for individuals from the same group are not overly influenced either by (i) a small fraction of the group (unlike the mean criterion), or (ii) unrelated subjects from different groups (unlike marginal median/quantile criteria). We introduce a new measure of value, the Average Conditional Median Effect (ACME), which summarizes across-group median treatment outcomes of a policy, and which the median optimal treatment regime maximizes. After developing key motivating examples that distinguish median optimal treatment regimes from mean and marginal median optimal treatment regimes, we give a nonparametric efficiency bound for estimating the ACME of a policy, and propose a new doubly robust-style estimator that achieves the efficiency bound under weak conditions. To construct the median optimal treatment regime, we introduce a new doubly robust-style estimator for the conditional median treatment effect.

Fully-developed turbulence obtained from DNS of a turbulent pipe flow is provided at the jet orifice. The volumetric flow rate at the orifice is modulated in time according to a damped sine wave; thereby allowing for control of the number of pulses, duration, and peak amplitude. The resulting vortex structures are analyzed for single-, two-, and three-pulse jets. The evolution of the particle cloud is then compared to existing single-pulse models. Particle dispersion and penetration of the entire cloud is found to be hindered by increased pulsatility.

Based on radiative transfer (RT) models of clumpy AGN tori, hot dust emission from the torus contributes negligibly to the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) at $\lambda\ga100$ \micron. However, these models do not include AGN heating of host-galaxy-scale diffuse dust, which may have far-IR (FIR) colors comparable to cold diffuse dust heated by stars. To quantify the contribution of AGN heating to host-galaxy-scale cold dust emission at $\lambda\ga100$ \micron, we perform dust RT calculations on a simulated galaxy merger both including and excluding the bright AGN that it hosts. By differencing the SEDs yielded by RT calculations with and without AGN that are otherwise identical, we quantify the FIR cold dust emission arising solely from re-processed AGN photons. In extreme cases, AGN-heated host-galaxy-scale dust can increase galaxy-integrated FIR flux densities by factors of 2-4; star formation rates calculated from the FIR luminosity assuming no AGN contribution can overestimate the true value by comparable factors. Because the FIR colors of such systems are similar to those of purely star-forming galaxies and redder than torus models, broadband SED decomposition may be insufficient for disentangling the contributions of stars and heavily dust-enshrouded AGN in the most IR-luminous galaxies. We demonstrate how kpc-scale resolved observations can be used to identify deeply dust-enshrouded AGN with cool FIR colors when spectroscopic and/or X-ray detection methods are unavailable.

We model the local surroundings of the embedded BBHs using a wind tunnel formalism and characterize different accretion regimes based on the local properties of the disk, which range from wind-dominated to quasi-spherical. We use our simulations to develop prescriptions for mass accretion and drag for embedded BBHs. We use these prescriptions, along with AGN disk models that can represent the Toomre-unstable outer regions of AGN disks, to study the long-term evolution of the BBHs as they migrate through the disk. We find that BBHs typically merge within $\lesssim 5-30\,{\rm Myr}$, increasing their mass significantly in the process, allowing BBHs to enter (or cross) the pair-instability supernova mass gap. The rate at which gas is supplied to these BBHs often exceeds the Eddington limit, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. We conclude that most embedded BBHs will merge before migrating significantly in the disk.

We also discuss possible electromagnetic signatures during and following the inspiral, finding that it is generally unlikely but not inconceivable for the bolometric luminosity of the BBH to exceed that of the host AGN.

The expansion rate $H_0$ is thought to be spatially constant, while bulk flows are often presumed to be negligible compared to the Hubble expansion, even at local scales. Their effects on the redshift-distance conversion are hence usually ignored. Any deviation from this consensus can strongly bias the results of such studies and thus the importance of testing these assumptions cannot be understated. Scaling relations of galaxy clusters can be effectively used for that. In previous works, we observed strong anisotropies in cluster scaling relations, whose origins remain ambiguous. By measuring many different cluster properties, several scaling relations with different sensitivities can be built. Nearly independent tests of cosmic isotropy and bulk flows are then feasible. We make use of up to 570 clusters with measured properties at X-ray, microwave, and infrared wavelengths, to construct 10 different cluster scaling relations (five of them presented for the first time) and test the isotropy of the local Universe. Through rigorous tests, we ensure that our analysis is not prone to generally known systematic biases and X-ray absorption issues. By combining all available information, we detect an apparent $9\%$ spatial variation in the local $H_0$ between $(l,b)\sim ({280^{\circ}}^{+35^{\circ}}_{-35^{\circ}},{-15^{\circ}}^{+20^{\circ}}_{-20^{\circ}})$ and the rest of the sky. The observed anisotropy has a nearly dipole form. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the statistical significance of the anisotropy to be $>5\sigma$.

Estimators are often shown extra obsolete requirements together with the real ones to be implemented. Only one previous study has been conducted on if such practices bias the estimations. Objective: We conducted six experiments with both students and practitioners to study, and quantify, the effects of obsolete requirements on software estimation. Method By conducting a family of six experiments using both students and practitioners as research subjects (N = 461), and by using a Bayesian Data Analysis approach, we investigated different aspects of this effect. We also argue for, and show an example of, how we by using a Bayesian approach can be more confident in our results and enable further studies with small sample sizes. Results: We found that the presence of obsolete requirements triggered an overestimation in effort across all experiments. The effect, however, was smaller in a field setting compared to using students as subjects. Still, the over-estimations triggered by the obsolete requirements were systematically around twice the percentage of the included obsolete ones, but with a large 95% credible interval. Conclusions: The results have implications for both research and practice in that the found systematic error should be accounted for in both studies on software estimation and, maybe more importantly, in estimation practices to avoid over-estimation due to this systematic error. We partly explain this error to be stemming from the cognitive bias of anchoring-and-adjustment, i.e. the obsolete requirements anchored a much larger software.

In the large imbalance regime, the equation of state turns out to be well described by a Landau-Pomeranchuk functional for two-dimensional polarons. To fully characterize this expansion, we determine the polarons' effective mass and their coupling parameter, complementing previous studies on their chemical potential. Furthermore, we extract the magnetic susceptibility from low-imbalance data, finding only small deviations from the mean-field prediction. While the mean-field theory predicts a direct transition from a paramagnetic to a fully ferromagnetic phase, our diffusion Monte Carlo results suggest that the partially ferromagnetic phase is stable in a narrow interval of the interaction parameter.

Light fields can, in particular, be used to isolate mesoscopic particles from their environment by levitating them optically. These levitated particles of micron size and smaller exhibit pristine mechanical resonances and can be cooled down to their motional quantum ground state. Significant roadblocks on the way to scale up levitation from a single to multiple particles in close proximity are the requirements to constantly monitor the particles' positions as well as to engineer light fields that react fast and appropriately to their displacements. Given the complexity of light scattering between particles, each of these two challenges currently seems insurmountable already in itself. Here, we present an approach that solves both problems at once by forgoing any local information on the particles. Instead, our procedure is based on the far-field information stored in the scattering matrix and its changes with time. We demonstrate how to compose from these ingredients a linear energy-shift operator, whose maximal or minimal eigenstates are identified as the incoming wavefronts that implement the most efficient heating or cooling of a moving ensemble of arbitrarily-shaped levitated particles, respectively. We expect this optimal approach to be a game-changer for the collective manipulation of multiple particles on-the-fly, i.e., without the necessity to track them.

These molecular clouds have complex structures, with substantial variation in their physical properties over a wide range of length scales. The propagation and distribution of the CRs is thus regulated accordingly, in particular, by the magnetic fields threaded through the clouds and into the dense regions within. We have found that a specific heating rate reaching $10^{-26}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ can be sustained in the dense clumps/cores for Galactic environments, and this rate increases with CR energy density. The propagation of CRs and heating rates in some star-forming filaments identified in IC 5146 are calculated, with the CR diffusion coefficients in these structures determined from magnetic field fluctuations inferred from optical and near-infrared polarizations of starlight, which is presumably a magnetic-field tracer. Our calculations indicate that CR heating can vary by nearly three orders of magnitude between different filaments within a cloud due to different levels of CR penetration. The CR ionization rate among these filaments is similar. The equilibrium temperature that could be maintained by CR heating alone is of order $1~{\rm K}$ in a Galactic environment, but this value would be higher in strongly star-forming environments, thus causing an increase in the Jeans mass of their molecular clouds.

To tackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation method. This technique rigorously describes the full thermodyamics of crystals accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. The approach requires the evaluation of the Born-Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in supercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles density-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry relaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used to determine the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables the calculation of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase transitions from the Hessian of the free energy. Finally, the code can also compute the anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well as phonon spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation and its dynamical extension, making particular emphasis on the physical interpretation of the variables present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with any other anharmonic theory. A modular and flexible Python environment is used for the implementation, which allows for a clean interaction with other packages.

All simulated galaxies experience an early period of bursty star formation that transitions to a late-time steady phase of near-constant star formation. Stars formed during the late-time steady phase have more circular orbits and thin-disc-like morphology at $z=0$, whilst stars born during the bursty phase have more radial orbits and thick-disc structure. The median age of thick-disc stars at $z=0$ correlates strongly with this transition time. We also find that galaxies with an earlier transition from bursty to steady star formation have a higher thin-disc fractions at $z=0$. Three of our systems have minor mergers with LMC-size satellites during the thin-disc phase. These mergers trigger short starbursts but do not destroy the thin disc nor alter broad trends between the star formation transition time and thin/thick disc properties. If our simulations are representative of the Universe, then stellar archaeological studies of the Milky Way (or M31) provide a window into past star-formation modes in the Galaxy.

We present new NIR spectra of 17 ClassI/Flat and 35 ClassII sources located in the young (<1Myr) NGC1333 cluster, acquired with the KMOS instrument at the VLT. Our goal is to study whether the mass accretion rate evolves with age, as suggested by the widely adopted viscous evolution model, by comparing the properties of the NGC1333 members with samples of older regions. We measured the stellar parameters and accretion rates of our sample, finding a correlation between accretion and stellar luminosity, and between mass accretion rate and stellar mass. Both correlations are compatible within the errors with the older Lupus star-forming region, while only the latter is consistent with results from ChamaeleonI. The ClassI sample shows larger accretion luminosities with respect to the ClassII stars of the same cloud. However, the derived accretion rates are not sufficiently high to build up the inferred stellar masses, assuming steady accretion during the ClassI lifetime. This suggests that the sources are not in their main accretion phase and that most of their mass has already been accumulated during a previous stage and/or that the accretion is an episodic phenomenon. We show that some of the targets originally classified as Class I through Spitzer photometry are in fact evolved or low accreting objects. This evidence can have implications for the estimated protostellar phase lifetimes. Further observations are needed to determine if this is a general result.

However, calculating it exactly or approximately is often challenging in practice. Here, we consider alternative definitions based on R\'enyi divergences. Their main advantage over their von Neumann counterpart is that they can be expressed as a variational problem whose cost function can be efficiently evaluated for families of states like matrix product operators while preserving all desirable properties of a measure of correlations.

Out of the three, RL is the least studied and it is still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark tasks. In this work, we introduce a training method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) that can be used to solve RL tasks for discrete and continuous state spaces based on the deep Q-learning algorithm. We investigate which architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents' success in a RL setting than the number of parameters used in the model.

However, the mean can be an unstable measure of centrality, resulting in imprecise statistical procedures, as well as unrobust decisions that can be overly influenced by a small fraction of subjects. In this work, we propose a new median optimal treatment regime that instead treats individuals whose conditional median is higher under treatment. This ensures that optimal decisions for individuals from the same group are not overly influenced either by (i) a small fraction of the group (unlike the mean criterion), or (ii) unrelated subjects from different groups (unlike marginal median/quantile criteria).
