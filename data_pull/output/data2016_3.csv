Wealthy countries have high-quality vital registration systems, but poor countries lack this infrastructure and must rely on estimates that are often problematic. In this paper, we introduce the network survival method, a new approach for estimating adult death rates. We derive the precise conditions under which it produces estimates that are consistent and unbiased. Further, we develop an analytical framework for sensitivity analysis. To assess the performance of the network survival method in a realistic setting, we conducted a nationally-representative survey experiment in Rwanda (n=4,669). Network survival estimates were similar to estimates from other methods, even though the network survival estimates were made with substantially smaller samples and are based entirely on data from Rwanda, with no need for model life tables or pooling of data from other countries. Our analytic results demonstrate that the network survival method has attractive properties, and our empirical results show that it can be used in countries where reliable estimates of adult death rates are sorely needed.

Interestingly, we find that $70.0\pm6.6$ % of the planets in this regime are inner components of multiplanetary systems. This value is 4.2$\sigma$ higher than for main-sequence hosts, which we find to be $42.4\pm0.1$ %. The properties of the known planets seem to indicate that the closest-in planets (a < 0.06 au) to main-sequence stars are massive (i.e., hot Jupiters) and isolated and that they are subsequently engulfed by their host as it evolves to the red giant branch, leaving only the predominant population of multiplanetary systems in orbits 0.06 < a < 0.5 au. We discuss the implications of this emerging observational trend in the context of formation and evolution of hot Jupiters. ","Close-in planets around giant stars. Lack of hot-Jupiters and prevalence

A pseudo-marginal MCMC method is proposed that estimates the likelihood by data subsampling using a block-Poisson estimator. The estimator is a product of Poisson estimators, allowing us to update a single block of subsample indicators in each MCMC iteration so that a desired correlation is achieved between the logs of successive likelihood estimates. This is important since pseudo-marginal MCMC with positively correlated likelihood estimates can use substantially smaller subsamples without adversely affecting the sampling efficiency. The block-Poisson estimator is unbiased but not necessarily positive, so the algorithm runs the MCMC on the absolute value of the likelihood estimator and uses an importance sampling correction to obtain consistent estimates of the posterior mean of any function of the parameters. Our article derives guidelines to select the optimal tuning parameters for our method and shows that it compares very favourably to regular MCMC without subsampling, and to two other recently proposed exact subsampling approaches in the literature.

We use two sets of red supergiant progenitor models with zero-age main sequence masses in the range between 9 Msol and 20 Msol. We find that the early properties of the light curve depend most sensitively on the radius of the progenitor, and thus provide a relation between the g-band rise time and the radius at the time of explosion. This relation will be useful for deriving constraints on progenitors from future observations, especially in cases where detailed modeling of the entire rise is not practical. When comparing to observed rise times, the radii we find are a factor of a few larger than previous semi-analytic derivations and generally in better agreement with what is found with current stellar evolution calculations.

This sample complements earlier studies of this effect, which employed smaller samples of better-characterized stars. For each Kepler binary we measure $e\cos\omega$ based on the relative timing of the primary and secondary eclipses. We examine the distribution of $e\cos\omega$ as a function of period for binaries composed of hot stars, cool stars, and mixtures of the two types. At the shortest periods, hot-hot binaries are most likely to be eccentric; for periods shorter than 4 days, significant eccentricities occur frequently for hot-hot binaries, but not for hot-cool or cool-cool binaries. This is in qualitative agreement with theoretical expectations based on the slower dissipation rates of hot stars.

To measure the similarity between images, they are typically embedded in a feature-vector space, in which their distance preserve the relative dissimilarity. However, when learning such similarity embeddings the simplifying assumption is commonly made that images are only compared to one unique measure of similarity. A main reason for this is that contradicting notions of similarities cannot be captured in a single space. To address this shortcoming, we propose Conditional Similarity Networks (CSNs) that learn embeddings differentiated into semantically distinct subspaces that capture the different notions of similarities. CSNs jointly learn a disentangled embedding where features for different similarities are encoded in separate dimensions as well as masks that select and reweight relevant dimensions to induce a subspace that encodes a specific similarity notion. We show that our approach learns interpretable image representations with visually relevant semantic subspaces. Further, when evaluating on triplet questions from multiple similarity notions our model even outperforms the accuracy obtained by training individual specialized networks for each notion separately.

This is done here: The propagator of a fundamental scalar is studied in two, three, and four dimensions in quenched SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in minimal Landau gauge, both in momentum space and position space.

These are a natural prediction of hierarchical galaxy formation, as accreted satellite galaxies are tidally disrupted by their host. We investigate whether or not global properties of the ESC could be used to test of dark matter, reasoning that they should be sensitive to the abundance of low-mass satellites, and therefore the underlying dark matter model. Using cosmological simulations of galaxy formation in the favoured Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM) models ($m_{\rm WDM}$=0.5,1,2 keV/$c^2$), which suppress the abundance of low-mass satellites, we find that the kinematics and orbital structure of the ESC is consistent across models. However, we find striking differences in its spatial structure, as anticipated -- a factor of $\sim$10 drop in spherically averaged mass density between $\sim$10% and $\sim$75% of the virial radius in the more extreme WDM runs ($m_{\rm WDM}$=0.5, 1 keV/$c^2$) relative to the CDM run. These differences are consistent with the mass assembly histories of the different components, and are present across redshifts. However, even the least discrepant of the WDM models is incompatible with current observational limits on $m_{\rm WDM}$. Importantly, the differences we observe when varying the underlying dark matter are comparable to the galaxy-to-galaxy variation we expect within a fixed dark matter model.

Following a topological approach we introduce cycles of varying length and analyze how this feature, as well as the position in the network, alters the synchronous behaviour. We show that in particular short cycles can lead to a maximum change of the Laplacian's eigenvalue spectrum, dictating the synchronization properties of such networks.

One compelling interpretation of the data is that it captures an $x_p$-dependent decrease in the average interaction strength of the nucleon in the projectile undergoing a hard scattering. A weakly interacting or ""shrinking"" nucleon in the projectile strikes fewer nucleons in the nucleus, resulting in a particular pattern of centrality-dependent modifications to high-$p_T$ processes. We describe a simple one-parameter geometric implementation of this picture within a modified Monte Carlo Glauber model tuned to $d$$+$Au jet data, and explore two of its major consequences. First, the model predicts a particular projectile-species dependence to the centrality dependence at high-$x_p$, opposite to that expected from an energy loss effect.

Generalizations of such principles to the graph setting can inform dictionary design for graph signals, lead to algorithms for reconstructing missing information from graph signals via sparse representations, and yield new graph analysis tools. While previous work has focused on generalizing notions of spreads of a graph signal in the vertex and graph spectral domains, our approach is to generalize the methods of Lieb in order to develop uncertainty principles that provide limits on the concentration of the analysis coefficients of any graph signal under a dictionary transform whose atoms are jointly localized in the vertex and graph spectral domains. One challenge we highlight is that due to the inhomogeneity of the underlying graph data domain, the local structure in a single small region of the graph can drastically affect the uncertainty bounds for signals concentrated in different regions of the graph, limiting the information provided by global uncertainty principles. Accordingly, we suggest a new way to incorporate a notion of locality, and develop local uncertainty principles that bound the concentration of the analysis coefficients of each atom of a localized graph spectral filter frame in terms of quantities that depend on the local structure of the graph around the center vertex of the given atom. Finally, we demonstrate how our proposed local uncertainty measures can improve the random sampling of graph signals. ",Global and Local Uncertainty Principles for Signals on Graphs

The observation of the transition from screened to unscreened behavior would be compelling evidence for beyond-GR physics. We show that pairwise peculiar velocity statistics, in particular the relative radial velocity dispersion, $\sigma_\parallel$ , can be used to observe this transition when they are binned by some measure of halo environment. We established this by measuring the radial velocity dispersion between pairs of halos in N-body simulations for three $f(R)$ gravity and four symmetron models. We developed an estimator involving only line-of-sight velocities to show that this quantity is observable, and binned the results in halo mass, ambient density, and the isolatedness of halos. Ambient density is found to be the most relevant measure of environment; it is distinct from isolatedness, and correlates well with theoretical expectations for the symmetron model. By binning $\sigma_\parallel$ in ambient density, we find a strong environment-dependent signature for the symmetron models, with the velocities showing a clear transition from GR to non-GR behavior. No such transition is observed for $f(R)$, as the relevant scales are deep in the unscreened regime. Observations of the relative radial velocity dispersion in forthcoming peculiar velocity surveys, if binned appropriately by environment, therefore offer a valuable way of detecting the screening signature of modified gravity.

Eclipses passing over populated areas such as Europe, China and India now regularly attract scientific attention, whereas atmospheric measurements of eclipses at remote locations remain rare. Many measurements and models have been used to exploit the uniquely predictable solar forcing provided by an eclipse. In this paper we compile the available publications and review a sub-set of them chosen on the basis of importance and novelty. Beyond the obvious reduction in incoming solar radiation, atmospheric cooling from eclipses can induce dynamical changes. Observations and meteorological modelling provide evidence for the generation of a local eclipse circulation which may be the origin of the ""eclipse wind"". Gravity waves set up by the eclipse can, in principle, be detected as atmospheric pressure fluctuations, though theoretical predictions are limited, and many of the data are inconclusive.

Our paper presents an alternative implementation of the correlated PM approach, called the block PM, which divides the underlying random numbers into blocks so that the likelihood estimates for the proposed and current values of the parameters only differ by the random numbers in one block. We show that this implementation of the correlated PM can be much more efficient for some specific problems than the implementation in Deligiannidis et al.

In this paper, we investigate the effects of compressibility on the atmospheric dynamics by solving the standard Euler equations. This is done by means of a series of simulations performed in the framework of the equatorial beta-plane approximation using the finite volume shock-capturing code RAMSES. At low resolution, we recover the classical results described in the literature: we find a strong and steady supersonic equatorial jet of a few km/s that displays no signature of shocks. We next show that the jet zonal velocity depends significantly on the grid meridional resolution. When that resolution is fine enough to properly resolve the jet, the latter is subject to a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The jet zonal mean velocity displays regular oscillations with a typical timescale of few days and a significant amplitude of about 15% of the jet velocity. We also find compelling evidence for the development of a vertical shear instability at pressure levels of a few bars. It seems to be responsible for an increased downward kinetic energy flux, significantly affecting the temperature of the deep atmosphere, and appears to act as a form of drag on the equatorial jet. This instability also creates velocity fluctuations that propagate upward and steepen into weak shocks at pressure levels of a few mbars. We conclude that hot Jupiter equatorial jets are potentially unstable to both a barotropic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and a vertical shear instability. Upon confirmation using more realistic models, both instabilities could result in significant time variability of the atmospheric winds, may provide a small scale dissipation mechanism in the flow, and might have consequences for the internal evolution of hot Jupiters.

All kSZ measurements to date have explicitly required spectroscopic redshifts. Here, we implement a novel estimator for the kSZ -- large-scale structure cross-correlation based on projected fields: it does not require redshift estimates for individual objects, allowing kSZ measurements from large-scale imaging surveys. We apply this estimator to cleaned CMB temperature maps constructed from Planck and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data and a galaxy sample from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We measure the kSZ effect at 3.8-4.5$\sigma$ significance, depending on the use of additional WISE galaxy bias constraints. We verify that our measurements are robust to possible dust emission from the WISE galaxies. Assuming the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we directly constrain $( {f_{b}}/{0.158} ) ( {f_{\rm free}}/{1.0} ) = 1.48 \pm 0.19$ (statistical error only) at redshift $z \approx 0.4$, where $f_{b}$ is the fraction of matter in baryonic form and $f_{\rm free}$ is the free electron fraction. This is the tightest kSZ-derived constraint reported to date on these parameters. The consistency between the $f_{b}$ value found here and the values inferred from analyses of the primordial CMB and Big Bang nucleosynthesis verifies that baryons approximately trace the dark matter distribution down to $\sim$Mpc scales. While our projected-field estimator is already competitive with other kSZ approaches when applied to current datasets (because we are able to use the full-sky WISE photometric survey), it will yield enormous signal-to-noise when applied to upcoming high-resolution, multi-frequency CMB surveys.

For slabs at coronal temperatures ($10^{6} \ {\rm K}$) and densities even orders of magnitude larger than expected for the compressed stellar wind ($10^{4}-10^{5} \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$), we find optical depths orders of magnitude too small ($> 3\times10^{-7}$) to explain the $\sim3\%$ UV transit depths seen with Hubble. Using this result and our modeling of slabs with lower temperatures ($2000-10^4 {\rm K}$), the conclusion is that the UV transits of WASP-12b and HD 189733b are likely due to atoms originating in the planet, as the stellar wind is too highly ionized.

We analyze K2 data for 65 Hyads and present $P_{rot}$ values for 48. Thirty-seven of these are new measurements, including the first $P_{rot}$ measurements for fully convective Hyads. For nine of the 11 stars with $P_{rot}$ in the literature and this work, the measurements are consistent; we attribute the two discrepant cases to spot evolution. Nearly all stars with masses $\le0.3M_\odot$ are rapidly rotating, indicating a change in rotation properties at the boundary to full convection. When confirmed and candidate binaries are removed from the mass-period plane, only three rapid rotators with masses $\ge0.3M_\odot$ remain. This is in contrast to previous results showing that the single-valued mass-period sequence for $\approx$600 Myr-old stars ends at $\approx0.65M_\odot$ when binaries are included. We also find that models of rotational evolution predict faster rotation than is actually observed at $\approx$600 Myrs for stars $\le0.9M_\odot$. The dearth of single rapid rotators more massive than $\approx0.3M_\odot$ indicates that magnetic braking is more efficient than previously thought, and that age-rotation studies must account for multiplicity.

Depending on the position of the probe the currents exhibit unique signatures such as a quasi-stationary plateau indicating the presence of meta-stability and multi-exponential decays in case of multiple symmetries. The signatures are sensitive to the probe and vanish completely when the timescale of the coherent system dynamics is much longer than the timescale of the probe.

We find active region filaments might have weak fields after all <LINK>'],http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04645,"Recent spectropolarimetric observations of active region filaments have revealed polarization profiles with signatures typical of the strong field Zeeman regime. The conspicuous absence in those observations of scattering polarization and Hanle effect signatures was then pointed out by some authors. This was interpreted either as a signature of mixed ""turbulent"" field components or as a result of optical thickness. In this article, we present a natural scenario to explain these Zeeman-only spectro-polarimetric observations of active region filaments. We propose a two-component model, one on top of the other. Both components have horizontal fields, the azimuth difference between them being close to 90 degrees. The component that lies lower in the atmosphere is permeated by a strong field of the order of 600 G, while the upper component has much weaker fields, of the order of 10 G. The ensuing scattering polarization signatures of the individual components have opposite signs, so that its combination along the line of sight reduces --and even can cancel out-- the Hanle signatures, giving rise to an apparent only-Zeeman profile. This model is also applicable to other chromospheric structures seen in absorption above active regions. ",Active region filaments might harbor weak magnetic fields

Molecular Hydrogen in #supernova 1987A. \n<LINK> <LINK>'],https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05560,"Both CO and SiO have been observed at early and late phases in SN 1987A. H_2 was predicted to form at roughly the same time as these molecules, but was not detected at early epochs. Here we report the detection of NIR lines from H_2 at 2.12 mu and 2.40 mu in VLT/SINFONI spectra obtained between days 6489 and 10,120. The emission is concentrated to the core of the supernova in contrast to H-alpha and approximately coincides with the [Si I]/[Fe II] emission detected previously in the ejecta. Different excitation mechanisms and power sources of the emission are discussed. From the nearly constant H_2 luminosities we favour excitation resulting from the 44Ti decay.
