Against these data, we test both static and dynamic predictions of two neutral models, including the relation between corpus size and vocabulary size, frequency distributions, and turnover within those frequency distributions. Although a commonly used Neutral model fails to replicate all these emergent properties at once, we find that modified two-stage Neutral model does replicate the static and dynamic properties of the corpus data. This two-stage model is meant to represent a relatively small corpus (population) of English books, analogous to a `canon', sampled by an exponentially increasing corpus of books in the wider population of authors. More broadly, this mode -- a smaller neutral model within a larger neutral model -- could represent more broadly those situations where mass attention is focused on a small subset of the cultural variants.

Despite these two phenomena strongly depending on one another and their fundamental importance in understanding cities, little work has been done in order to compare their evolution and their local and global properties. The contribution of this paper aims to highlight the strong relationship that retail dynamics have with the hierarchical structure of the underlying road network. We achieve this by comparing the results of the entropy maximising retail model with a percolation analysis of the road network in the city of London. We interpret the great agreement in the hierarchical spatial organisation outlined by these two approaches as new evidence of the interdependence of these two crucial dimensions of a city's life.

More complex models such as viscoelastic, fractional viscoelastic, poroelastic, or poroviscoelastic ones are also used. These models appear at first sight to be very different, but here it is shown that they all may be expressed in terms of elementary viscoelastic models. For a medium expressed with fractional models, many elementary spring-damper combinations are added, each of them weighted according to a long-tailed distribution, hinting at a fractional distribution of time constants or relaxation frequencies. This may open up for a more physical interpretation of the fractional models. The shear wave component of the poroelastic model is shown to be modeled exactly by a three-component Zener model. The extended poroviscoelastic model is found to be equivalent to what is called a non-standard four-parameter model. Accordingly, the large number of parameters in the porous models can be reduced to the same number as in their viscoelastic equivalents. As long as the individual displacements from the solid and fluid parts cannot be measured individually the main use of the poro(visco)elastic models is therefore as a physics based method for determining parameters in a viscoelastic model.

An ""EIT wave"" was observed on 6 July 2012 to impact an adjacent trans-equatorial loop system which then exhibited a decaying oscillation as it returned to rest. Observations of the loop oscillations were used to estimate the magnetic field strength of the loop system by studying the decaying oscillation of the loop, measuring the propagation of ubiquitous transverse waves in the loop and extrapolating the magnetic field from observed magnetograms. Observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/AIA) and the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) were used to study the event. An Empirical Mode Decomposition analysis was used to characterise the oscillation of the loop system in CoMP Doppler velocity and line width and in AIA intensity. The loop system was shown to oscillate in the 2nd harmonic mode rather than at the fundamental frequency, with the seismological analysis returning an estimated magnetic field strength of ~5.5+/-1.5 G.

Our model relies on two key ingredients: a nonlocal constraint on the action, which forces the spacetime average of the Lagrangian density to vanish, and a dynamical way for this condition to be satisfied classically with arbitrary matter content. We implement the former condition with a spatially-constant Lagrange multiplier associated with the volume form and the latter by including a free four-form gauge field strength in the action. These two features are enough to remove the cosmological constant from the Einstein equation.

The inhomogeneity is introduced via step functions in the reaction progress variable, with the local value of energy release correspondingly increased so as to maintain the same average energy density in the medium, and thus a constant Chapman Jouguet (CJ) detonation velocity. A one-step Arrhenius rate governs the rate of energy release in the reactive zones. The resulting dynamics of a detonation propagating in such systems with one-dimensional layers and two-dimensional squares are simulated using a Godunov-type finite-volume scheme. The resulting wave dynamics are analyzed by computing the average wave velocity and one-dimensional averaged wave structure. In the case of sufficiently inhomogeneous media wherein the spacing between reactive zones is greater than the inherent reaction zone length, average wave speeds significantly greater than the corresponding CJ speed of the homogenized medium are obtained. If the shock transit time between reactive zones is less than the reaction time scale, then the classical CJ detonation velocity is recovered. The spatio-temporal averaged structure of the waves in these systems is analyzed via a Favre averaging technique, with terms associated with the thermal and mechanical fluctuations being explicitly computed. The analysis of the averaged wave structure identifies the super-CJ detonations as weak detonations owing to the existence of mechanical non-equilibrium at the effective sonic point embedded within the wave structure. The correspondence of the super-CJ behavior identified in this study with real detonation phenomena that may be observed in experiments is discussed.

The large 2-square degree survey area delivers a sample of $\sim400$ such ultra-massive systems. Accurate sizes are derived using a calibration based on high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that, at these very high masses, the size evolution of star-forming and quiescent galaxies is almost indistinguishable in terms of normalization and power-law slope. We use this result to investigate possible pathways of quenching massive $m>M^*$ galaxies at $z<2$. We consistently model the size evolution of quiescent galaxies from the star-forming population by assuming different simple models for the suppression of star-formation. These models include an instantaneous and delayed quenching without altering the structure of galaxies and a central starburst followed by compaction. We find that instantaneous quenching reproduces well the observed mass-size relation of massive galaxies at $z>1$. Our starburst$+$compaction model followed by individual growth of the galaxies by minor mergers is preferred over other models without structural change for $\log(m/M_{\odot})>11.0$ galaxies at $z>0.5$.

The concept of so-called configuration shift-symmetry is applied to two-dimensional cellular automata as an ideal model of computation. Regardless of the transition function, the results show the universal insolvability of crucial distributed tasks, such as leader election, pattern recognition, hashing, and encryption. By using compact enumeration formulas and bounding the number of shift-symmetric configurations for a given lattice size, we efficiently calculate the probability of a configuration being shift-symmetric for a uniform or density-uniform distribution. Further, we devise an algorithm detecting the presence of shift-symmetry in a configuration. Given the resource constraints, the enumeration and probability formulas can directly help to lower the minimal expected error and provide recommendations for system's size and initialization.

The method builds upon so-called label ranking algorithms, which we complement with appropriate kernels providing a similarity measure for verification tasks. Our kernels employ a graph representation for software source code that mixes elements of control flow and program dependence graphs with abstract syntax trees.

However, for a number of problems the LSH framework is not known to yield good solutions, and instead ad hoc solutions have been designed for particular similarity and distance measures. For example, this is true for output-sensitive similarity search/join, and for indexes supporting annulus queries that aim to report a point close to a certain given distance from the query point. In this paper we initiate the study of distance-sensitive hashing (DSH), a generalization of LSH that seeks a family of hash functions such that the probability of two points having the same hash value is a given function of the distance between them. More precisely, given a distance space $(X, \text{dist})$ and a ""collision probability function"" (CPF) $f\colon \mathbb{R}\rightarrow [0,1]$ we seek a distribution over pairs of functions $(h,g)$ such that for every pair of points $x, y \in X$ the collision probability is $\Pr[h(x)=g(y)] = f(\text{dist}(x,y))$. Locality-sensitive hashing is the study of how fast a CPF can decrease as the distance grows. For many spaces, $f$ can be made exponentially decreasing even if we restrict attention to the symmetric case where $g=h$. We show that the asymmetry achieved by having a pair of functions makes it possible to achieve CPFs that are, for example, increasing or unimodal, and show how this leads to principled solutions to problems not addressed by the LSH framework. This includes a novel application to privacy-preserving distance estimation. We believe that the DSH framework will find further applications in high-dimensional data management.

Here we use N-body simulations with synthetic forces from an underlying evolving gaseous disk to model the formation and long-term dynamical evolution of super-Earth systems. While the gas disk is present, planetary embryos grow and migrate inward to form a resonant chain anchored at the inner edge of the disk. These resonant chains are far more compact than the observed super-Earth systems. Once the gas dissipates resonant chains may become dynamically unstable. They undergo a phase of giant impacts that spreads the systems out. Disk turbulence has no measurable effect on the outcome. Our simulations match observations if a small fraction of resonant chains remain stable, while most super-Earths undergo a late dynamical instability. Our statistical analysis restricts the contribution of stable systems to less than $25\%$. Our results also suggest that the large fraction of observed single planet systems does not necessarily imply any dichotomy in the architecture of planetary systems. Finally, we use the low abundance of resonances in Kepler data to argue that, in reality, the survival of resonant chains happens likely only in $\sim 5\%$ of the cases. This leads to a mystery: in our simulations only 50-60\% of resonant chains became unstable whereas at least 75\% (and probably 90-95\%) must be unstable to match observations.

We compute the element formation in disk outflows from hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) remnants of variable lifetime, including the effect of angular momentum transport in the disk evolution. We employ long-term axisymmetric hydrodynamic disk simulations to model the ejecta, and compute r-process nucleosynthesis with tracer particles using a nuclear reaction network containing $\sim 8000$ species. We find that the previously known strong correlation between HMNS lifetime, ejected mass, and average electron fraction in the outflow is directly related to the amount of neutrino irradiation on the disk, which dominates mass ejection at early times in the form of a neutrino-driven wind. Production of lanthanides and actinides saturates at short HMNS lifetimes ($\lesssim 10$ ms), with additional ejecta contributing to a blue optical kilonova component for longer-lived HMNSs. We find good agreement between the abundances from the disk outflow alone and the solar r-process distribution only for short HMNS lifetimes ($\lesssim 10$ ms). For longer lifetimes, the rare-earth and third r-process peaks are significantly under-produced compared to the solar pattern, requiring additional contributions from the dynamical ejecta. The nucleosynthesis signature from a spinning black hole (BH) can only overlap with that from a HMNS of moderate lifetime ($\lesssim 60$ ms). Finally, we show that angular momentum transport not only contributes with a late-time outflow component, but that it also enhances the neutrino-driven component by moving material to shallower regions of the gravitational potential, in addition to providing additional heating.

This allows for quickly sampling from a broad class of stochastic blockmodel graphs (degree-corrected, mixed membership, overlapping) all of which are specific parameterizations of the generalized random product graph model defined in Section 2.2. The basic idea of fastRG is to first sample the number of edges $m$ and then sample each edge. The key insight is that because of the the low rank expectation, it is easy to sample individual edges. The naive ""element-wise"" algorithm requires $O(n^2)$ operations to generate the $n\times n$ adjacency matrix $A$. In sparse graphs, where $m = O(n)$, ignoring log terms, fastRG runs in time $O(n)$. An implementation in fastRG is available on github. A computational experiment in Section 2.4 simulates graphs up to $n=10,000,000$ nodes with $m = 100,000,000$ edges. For example, on a graph with $n=500,000$ and $m = 5,000,000$, fastRG runs in less than one second on a 3.5 GHz Intel i5. ",A note on quickly sampling a sparse matrix with low rank expectation

They are inspired by Biological Neural Networks (BNNs) and provide an intuitive and abstract representation of how BNNs work. Derived from the more generic Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the recurrent ones are meant to be used for temporal tasks, such as speech recognition, because they are capable of memorizing historic input. However, such networks are very time consuming to train as a result of their inherent nature. Recently, Echo State Networks and Liquid State Machines have been proposed as possible RNN alternatives, under the name of Reservoir Computing (RC). RCs are far more easy to train. In this paper, Cellular Automata are used as reservoir, and are tested on the 5-bit memory task (a well known benchmark within the RC community). The work herein provides a method of mapping binary inputs from the task onto the automata, and a recurrent architecture for handling the sequential aspects of it. Furthermore, a layered (deep) reservoir architecture is proposed. Performances are compared towards earlier work, in addition to its single-layer version. Results show that the single CA reservoir system yields similar results to state-of-the-art work. The system comprised of two layered reservoirs do show a noticeable improvement compared to a single CA reservoir. This indicates potential for further research and provides valuable insight on how to design CA reservoir systems. ",Deep Reservoir Computing Using Cellular Automata

We define a cluster sub-sample of 790 redshifts which lie within a velocity range of 14,000 to 22,000 kms$^{-1}$ and within 1 degree of the cluster centre. A detailed structural analysis finds A3266 to have a complex dynamical structure containing six groups and filaments to the north of the cluster as well as a cluster core which can be decomposed into two components split along a northeast-southwest axis, consistent with previous X-ray observations. The mean redshift of the cluster core is found to be $0.0594 \pm 0.0005$ and the core velocity dispersion is given as $1462^{+99}_{-99}$ kms$^{-1}$. The overall velocity dispersion and redshift of the entire cluster and related structures are $1337^{+67}_{-67}$ kms$^{-1}$ and $0.0596 \pm 0.0002$, respectively, though the high velocity dispersion does not represent virialised motions but rather is due to relative motions of the cluster components. We posit A3266 is seen following a merger along the northeast southwest axis, however, the rich substructure in the rest of the cluster suggests that the dynamical history is more complex than just a simple merger with a range of continuous dynamical interactions taking place. It is thus likely that turbulence in A3266 is very high, even for a merging cluster. ",Dynamics of Abell 3266 - I. An Optical View of a Complex Merging Cluster

We consider both Galaxy Clustering and Weak Lensing surveys, showing the impact of the non-linear regime, treated with two different semi-analytical approximations. In addition to these future observables, we use a prior covariance matrix derived from the Planck observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background. Our results show that $\eta$ and $\mu$ in different redshift bins are significantly correlated, but including non-linear scales reduces or even eliminates the correlation, breaking the degeneracy between Modified Gravity parameters and the overall amplitude of the matter power spectrum. We further decorrelate parameters with a Zero-phase Component Analysis and identify which combinations of the Modified Gravity parameter amplitudes, in different redshift bins, are best constrained by future surveys. We also extend the analysis to two particular parameterizations of the time evolution of $\mu$ and $\eta$ and consider, in addition to Euclid, also SKA1, SKA2, DESI: we find in this case that future surveys will be able to constrain the current values of $\eta$ and $\mu$ at the $2-5\%$ level when using only linear scales (wavevector k < 0.15 h/Mpc), depending on the specific time parameterization; sensitivity improves to about $1\%$ when non-linearities are included.

We constructed general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics models for these sources that qualitatively well describe their spectra and radio/mm images invoking a coupled jet-disk system. Using general relativistic polarized radiative transfer, we now also model the observed mm rotation measure (RM) of M87. The models are tied to the observed radio flux, however, electron temperature and accretion rate are degenerate parameters and are allowed to vary. For the inferred low viewing angles of the M87 jet, the RM is low even as the black hole $\mdot$ increases by a factor of $\simeq100$. In jet-dominated models, the observed linear polarization is produced in the forward-jet, while the dense accretion disk depolarizes the bulk of the near-horizon scale emission which originates in the counter-jet. In the jet-dominated models, with increasing $\mdot$ and increasing Faraday optical depth one is progressively sensitive only to polarized emission in the forward-jet, keeping the measured RM relatively constant. The jet-dominated model reproduces a low net-polarization of $\simeq1$ per cent and RMs in agreement with observed values due to Faraday depolarization, however, with $\mdot$ much larger than the previously inferred limit of $9\times10^{-4}\,\mdotu$. All jet-dominated models produce much higher RMs for inclination angles $i\gtrsim30^\circ$, where the line-of-sight passes through the accretion flow, thereby providing independent constraints on the viewing geometry of the M87 jet.

We have considered this process using canonical examples of two different classes of ions: a simple alkali-halide pair, Na$^+$I$^-$, or classical ions, and the products of water autoionization, H$_3$O$^+$OH$^-$, or water ions. We find that for both ion classes, the microscopic mechanism of charge separation, including water's collective role in the process, is conserved between the bulk liquid and the electrode interface. Despite this, the thermodynamic and kinetic details of the process differ between these two environments in a way that depends on ion type. In the case of the classical ion pairs, a higher free energy barrier to charge separation and a smaller flux over that barrier at the interface, results in a rate of dissociation that is 40x slower relative to the bulk. For water ions, a slightly higher free energy barrier is offset by a higher flux over the barrier from longer lived hydrogen bonding patters at the interface, resulting in a rate of association that is similar both at and away from the interface. We find that these differences in rates and stabilities of charge separation are due to the altered ability of water to solvate and reorganize in the vicinity of the metal interface.

The first Gaia Data Release contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which, besides the position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are calculated using Hipparcos and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior information. Aims. We investigate the scientific potential and limitations of the TGAS component by means of the astrometric data for open clusters. Methods. Mean cluster parallax and proper motion values are derived taking into account the error correlations within the astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the internal velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects of the depth of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency of the TGAS data is assessed. Results. Values given for standard uncertainties are still inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic unit-weight standard deviations of least squares solutions for cluster parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster parallax and proper motion values are generally in very good agreement with earlier Hipparcos-based determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the Pleiades is a significant exception. We have no current explanation for that discrepancy. Most clusters are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from the cluster centre, and it will be up to future Gaia releases to establish whether those potential cluster-member stars are still dynamically bound to the clusters. Conclusions. The Gaia DR1 provides the means to examine open clusters far beyond their more easily visible cores, and can provide membership assessments based on proper motions and parallaxes. A combined HR diagram shows the same features as observed before using the Hipparcos data, with clearly increased luminosities for older A and F dwarfs. ","Gaia Data Release 1.
