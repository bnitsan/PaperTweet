We expect to observe a wide variety of atmospheres and planets with alternative evolutionary paths, with some planets resembling Earth at different epochs. For an Earth-like atmospheric time trajectory, we simulate planets from prebiotic to current atmosphere based on geological data. We use a stellar grid F0V to M8V ($T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 7000$\mskip3mu$K to 2400$\mskip3mu$K) to model four geological epochs of Earth's history corresponding to a prebiotic world (3.9$\mskip3mu$Ga), the rise of oxygen at 2.0$\mskip3mu$Ga and at 0.8$\mskip3mu$Ga, and the modern Earth. We show the VIS - IR spectral features, with a focus on biosignatures through geological time for this grid of Sun-like host stars and the effect of clouds on their spectra. We find that the observability of biosignature gases reduces with increasing cloud cover and increases with planetary age. The observability of the visible O$_2$ feature for lower concentrations will partly depend on clouds, which while slightly reducing the feature increase the overall reflectivity thus the detectable flux of a planet. The depth of the IR ozone feature contributes substantially to the opacity at lower oxygen concentrations especially for the high near-UV stellar environments around F stars. Our results are a grid of model spectra for atmospheres representative of Earth's geological history to inform future observations and instrument design and are publicly available online.

However investigating how mentions of real-world entities appear and spread has yet to be explored, largely due to the computationally intractable nature of performing large-scale entity extraction. In this paper we present, to the best of our knowledge, one of the first pieces of work to closely examine the diffusion of named entities on social media, using Reddit as our case study platform. We first investigate how named entities can be accurately recognised and extracted from discussion posts. We then use these extracted entities to study the patterns of entity cascades and how the probability of a user adopting an entity (i.e. mentioning it) is associated with exposures to the entity. We put these pieces together by presenting a parallelised diffusion model that can forecast the probability of entity adoption, finding that the influence of adoption between users can be characterised by their prior interactions -- as opposed to whether the users propagated entity-adoptions beforehand. Our findings have important implications for researchers studying influence and language, and for community analysts who wish to understand entity-level influence dynamics.

The central mechanism that protects the oscillator from fluctuations is a collective enhancement of precision, where a population of coupled oscillators displays higher temporal precision than that achieved without coupling. Since coupling is essentially information exchange between oscillators, we herein investigate the relation between the temporal precision and the information flow between oscillators in the linearized Kuramoto model by using stochastic thermodynamics. For general coupling, we find that the temporal precision is bounded from below by the information flow. We generalize the model to incorporate a time-delayed coupling and demonstrate that the same relation also holds for the time-delayed case. Furthermore, the temporal precision is demonstrated to be improved in the presence of the time delay, and we show that the increased information flow is responsible for the time-delay-induced precision improvement.

While encryption effectively hides the contents of memory, the sequence of address references issued by the secret code leaks information. This is a serious problem because these leaks can easily break the confidentiality guarantees of enclaves. In this paper, we explore Oblivious RAM (ORAM) designs that prevent these information leaks under the constraints of modern SGX processors. Most ORAMs are a poor fit for these processors because they have high constant overhead factors or require large private memories, which are not available in these processors. We address these limitations with a new hierarchical ORAM construction, the Pyramid ORAM, that is optimized towards online bandwidth cost and small blocks. It uses a new hashing scheme that circumvents the complexity of previous hierarchical schemes. We present an efficient x64-optimized implementation of Pyramid ORAM that uses only the processor's registers as private memory. We compare Pyramid ORAM with Circuit ORAM, a state-of-the-art tree-based ORAM scheme that also uses constant private memory. Pyramid ORAM has better online asymptotical complexity than Circuit ORAM. Our implementation of Pyramid ORAM and Circuit ORAM validates this: as all hierarchical schemes, Pyramid ORAM has high variance of access latencies; although latency can be high for some accesses, for typical configurations Pyramid ORAM provides access latencies that are 8X better than Circuit ORAM for 99% of accesses. Although the best known hierarchical ORAM has better asymptotical complexity, Pyramid ORAM has significantly lower constant overhead factors, making it the preferred choice in practice.

We argue that this will lead to two important effects - a thermal contribution to the potential and a gradual change in parameters in the Lagrangian which results from thermodynamic and energy conservation arguments. We present a scenario of hilltop inflation where the field starts trapped at the origin before slowly experiencing a phase transition during which the field extremely slowly moves towards its zero temperature expectation value. We show that it is possible to obtain enough e-folds of expansion as well as the correct spectrum of perturbations without hugely fine-tuned parameters in the potential (albeit with many spectator fields).

At fixed stellar mass, the red fraction is on average higher for satellites of red centrals than of blue (star-forming) centrals, a galactic conformity effect that increases with density. Most of the signal originates from groups that have the highest stellar mass, reside in the densest environments, and have massive, red only centrals. Assuming a color-dependent halo-to-stellar-mass ratio, whereby red central galaxies inhabit significantly more massive halos than blue ones of the same stellar mass, two regimes emerge more distinctly: at log(Mhalo/Msol) < 13, central quenching is still ongoing, conformity is no longer existent, and satellites and group centrals exhibit the same quenching excess over field galaxies at all mass and density, in agreement with the concept of ""group quenching""; at log(Mhalo/Msol) > 13, a cutoff that sets apart massive (log(M*/Msol) > 11), fully quenched group centrals, conformity is meaningless, and satellites undergo significantly more quenching than their counterparts in smaller halos. The latter effect strongly increases with density, giving rise to the density-dependent conformity signal when both regimes are mixed. The star-formation of blue satellites in massive halos is also suppressed compared to blue field galaxies, while blue group centrals and the majority of blue satellites, which reside in low mass halos, show no deviation from the color-stellar mass relation of blue field galaxies.

A central question for such networks is that of identifiability, which essentially asks under what circumstances can we reliably identify the phylogenetic network that gave rise to the observed data? Recently, identifiability results have appeared for networks relative to a model of sequence evolution that generalizes the standard Markov models used for phylogenetic trees. However, these results are quite limited in terms of the complexity of the networks that are considered. In this paper, by introducing an alternative probabilistic model for evolution along a network that is based on some ground-breaking work by Thatte for pedigrees, we are able to obtain an identifiability result for a much larger class of phylogenetic networks (essentially the class of so-called tree-child networks). To prove our main theorem, we derive some new results for identifying tree-child networks combinatorially, and then adapt some techniques developed by Thatte for pedigrees to show that our combinatorial results imply identifiability in the probabilistic setting. We hope that the introduction of our new model for networks could lead to new approaches to reliably construct phylogenetic networks. ","Identifiability of tree-child phylogenetic networks under a

Our Solar System's Titan is a prototypical hazy planet, whose atmosphere may be representative of a large number of planets in our Galaxy. As a step towards characterizing such worlds, we present simulations of exoplanets that resemble Titan, but orbit three different stellar hosts: G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. We use general circulation and photochemistry models to explore the circulation and chemistry of these Titan-like planets under varying stellar spectra, in all cases assuming a Titan-like insolation. Due to the strong absorption of visible light by atmospheric haze, the redder radiation accompanying later stellar types produces more isothermal stratospheres, stronger meridional temperature gradients at mbar pressures, and deeper and stronger zonal winds. In all cases, the planets' atmospheres are strongly superrotating, but meridional circulation cells are weaker aloft under redder starlight. The photochemistry of hydrocarbon and nitrile species varies with stellar spectra, with variations in the FUV/NUV flux ratio playing an important role. Our results tentatively suggest that column haze production rates could be similar under all three hosts, implying that planets around many different stars could have similar characteristics to Titan's atmosphere. Lastly, we present theoretical emission spectra. Overall, our study indicates that, despite important and subtle differences, the circulation and chemistry of Titan-like exoplanets are relatively insensitive to differences in host star.

We propose that this relation could arise from collisional interactions between baryons and dark matter (DM) particles, without the need for modification of gravity or ad hoc feedback processes. We assume that these interactions satisfy the following three conditions: (i) the relaxation time of DM particles is comparable to the dynamical time in disk galaxies; (ii) DM exchanges energy with baryons due to elastic collisions; (iii) the product between the baryon-DM cross section and the typical energy exchanged in a collision is inversely proportional to the DM number density. We present an example of a particle physics model that gives a DM-baryon cross section with the desired density and velocity dependence. Direct detection constraints require our DM particles to be either very light ($m << m_b$) or very heavy ($m >> m_b$), corresponding respectively to heating and cooling of DM by baryons. In both cases, our mechanism applies and an equilibrium configuration can in principle be reached. Here, we focus on the heavy DM/cooling case as it is technically simpler. Under these assumptions, we find that rotationally-supported disk galaxies could naturally settle to equilibrium configurations satisfying a MDAR at all radii without invoking finely tuned feedback processes. We also discuss issues related to the small scale clumpiness of baryons, as well as predictions for pressure-supported systems. We argue in particular that galaxy clusters do not follow the MDAR despite being DM-dominated because they have not reached their equilibrium configuration. Finally, we revisit existing phenomenological, astrophysical and cosmological constraints on baryon-DM interactions in light of the unusual density dependence of the cross section.

We more than doubled the number of known ELCVn binaries which represent an interesting phase of binary evolution <LINK>'],https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06507,"We report the discovery and analysis of 36 new eclipsing EL CVn-type binaries, consisting of a core helium-composition pre-white dwarf and an early-type main-sequence companion, more than doubling the known population of these systems. We have used supervised machine learning methods to search 0.8 million lightcurves from the Palomar Transient Factory, combined with SDSS, Pan-STARRS and 2MASS colours. The new systems range in orbital periods from 0.46-3.8 d and in apparent brightness from ~14-16 mag in the PTF $R$ or $g^{\prime}$ filters. For twelve of the systems, we obtained radial velocity curves with the Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph at the Isaac Newton Telescope. We modelled the lightcurves, radial velocity curves and spectral energy distributions to determine the system parameters. The radii (0.3-0.7 $\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$) and effective temperatures (8000-17000 K) of the pre-He-WDs are consistent with stellar evolution models, but the masses (0.12-0.28 $\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) show more variance than models predicted. This study shows that using machine learning techniques on large synoptic survey data is a powerful way to discover substantial samples of binary systems in short-lived evolutionary stages.

In this study we employ precise ground based photometry from the private collection of Stetson, space photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope, literature abundances of Na and O, and APOGEE survey abundances for Mg, Al, C, and N. Multiple populations are identified by their position in the CU,B,I -V pseudo-CMD and confirmed with their chemical composition determined using abundances. We confirm the expectation from previous studies that the RGB in all seven clusters are split and the different branches have different chemical compositions. The Mg-Al anti-correlations were well explored by the APOGEE and Gaia-ESO surveys for most globular clusters, some clusters showing bimodal distributions, while others continuous distributions. Even though the structure (i.e., bimodal vs. continuous) of Mg-Al can greatly vary, the Al-rich and Al-poor populations do not seem to have very different photometric properties, agreeing with theoretical calculations. There is no one-to-one correspondence between the Mg-Al anticorrelation shape (bimodal vs. continuous) and the structure of the RGB seen in the HST pseudo-CMDs, with the HST photometric information usually implying more complex formation/evolution histories than the spectroscopic ones. We report on finding two second generation HB stars in M5, and five second generation AGB stars in M92, which is the most metal-poor cluster to date in which second generation AGB stars have been observed.
