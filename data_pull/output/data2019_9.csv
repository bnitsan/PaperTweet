While being a powerful algorithm, their work has focused on computer vision tasks, where it is comparatively easy to apply imperceptible perturbations without changing an image's semantic meaning. In our work, we adapt AutoAugment to automatically discover effective perturbation policies for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as dialogue generation. We start with a pool of atomic operations that apply subtle semantic-preserving perturbations to the source inputs of a dialogue task (e.g., different POS-tag types of stopword dropout, grammatical errors, and paraphrasing). Next, we allow the controller to learn more complex augmentation policies by searching over the space of the various combinations of these atomic operations. Moreover, we also explore conditioning the controller on the source inputs of the target task, since certain strategies may not apply to inputs that do not contain that strategy's required linguistic features. Empirically, we demonstrate that both our input-agnostic and input-aware controllers discover useful data augmentation policies, and achieve significant improvements over the previous state-of-the-art, including trained on manually-designed policies.

To be specific, a new approach to optical/infrared OIRSETI using coronagraphs built to image exoplanets: CORSETI. <LINK>', 'Lasers are great communication tools for sending signals long distances, so SETI has been looking for those in addition to radio signals. Lasers can focused and aimed at a target to be surprisingly bright even at interstellar distances. (Originally suggested by Charlie Townes.)', 'One problem. You know what else is bright? Stars. Really really bright at optical and infrared wavelengths. Millions of times brighter then a practical laser. And most hypothetical civilizations trying to communicate with us probably live near a star.', 'So you need a way to distinguish bright starlight from faint laser light. Historically there have been two ways to do this by exploiting properties of the laser.', ""First, lasers only make a single color / wavelength of light, and usually that's a very very narrow range of wavelengths. Much more monochromatic than any natural source and at very different wavelengths than any astronomical narrow-emissions sources."", 'In a high resolution spectrograph, a laser would look like a narrow spectroscopic line. e.g. Tellis et al 2017 who looked at spectrograph data used for a planet search. \nhttps://t.co/iCQin2B26v', 'The other usual approach is timing. Stars emit photons continuously. If the laser is pulsed, it will emit photons in pulses - multiple photons within microseconds or nanoseconds and then a gap. Hi-speed detectors can see this. @ikashell has a brilliant plan for this.', ""A third way the laser might be different than the star is that the laser probably isn't right on top of the star. (Stars are hot.) So you could look to see if there's a light source at a different position. Still hard if the laser is close to the star."", 'But seeing faint things next to bright stars is kind of our job! Instruments like the Gemini Planet Imager and the WFIRST coronagraph are built to image faint planets next to bright stars, but they could also see faintish lasers.', ""So we decided to calculate how powerful a laser we could see. You need to make some assumptions about the transmitter. We assumed a 10-m space telescope  being used to send the signal so it can produce a tightly focused beam. (Here's a cartoon). https://t.co/JHQScxJMRU"", ""And as in all OIRSETI, the sender has to be transmitting just at our solar system - in fact just at the Earth - on purpose. (But that's reasonable, because they already know we're here using their own exoplanet imagers.)"", ""We then calculated the detection limits for GPI using real data. GPI can see things about a million times fainter then a star. Around most nearby stars, GPI could see a laser with a power of 10-40 kilowatts. That's less powerful than military lasers that exist right now."", ""And since GPI is a spectrograph as well as an imager, you could distinguish a laser from a real planet easily. GPI hasn't actually looked at many stars that are good SETI targets - our typical target star is very young, before life emerged on Earth (let alone lasers)"", 'WFIRST could do even better. The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope will carry a prototype coronagraph capable of seeing things up to a billion times fainter than their host star. That translates into laser power from 0.5 - 50 watts.', ""That's pretty impressive. You can buy lasers that powerful on eBay. Hook it up to a 10-m telescope (not available on eBay) and you can signal tens of light years away."", 'I was actually surprised by how good this was, but in hindsight it makes sense. of course planets have much more total brightness than a laser. The luminosity of the Earth is about 10^16 watts. But the laser is aimed and focused!', 'A 10-m telescope launches a 1 micron laser into a beam that is 10^-7 radians across, for a 10^14 concentrate of power.  So laser transmitters can be as bright as a planet with either a big laser or a big transmitter telescope.', ""Where next? It'd be nice to reduce GPI and other current coronagraph data just to doublecheck, though we don't expect to see signals from most stars. otherwise, the nice thing about this sort of SETI is that it's free - while you're looking for planets, just pay attention"", ""Huge amounts of credit to Christina Vides, who led the paper.

GPI and WFIRST could utilize a coronagraph to search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in the present and future. We use archival data for GPI stars and simulated WFIRST observations to find the detectable flux ratio of a laser signal to residual scattered starlight around the target star. This flux ratio is then converted to detectable power as a function of distance from the parent star. For GPI, we assume a monochromatic laser wavelength of 1.55 $\mu$m, and a wavelength of 575 nm for WFIRST. We assume the lasers are projected through a 10-m aperture, and that the intensity of the laser beam follows a Gaussian profile. Our analysis is performed on 6 stars with spectral types later than F within 20 pc (with an emphasis on solar analogs at different distances). The most notable result is the detection limit for $\tau$ Ceti, a G5V star with four known exoplanets, two of those within the habitable zone (HZ). The result shows that a 24 kW laser is detectable from $\tau$ Ceti from outside of the HZ with GPI and a 7.3 W laser is detectable from within $\tau$ Ceti's HZ by WFIRST.

Here we study open knowledge graph reasoning---a task that aims to reason for missing facts over a graph augmented by a background text corpus. A key challenge of the task is to filter out ""irrelevant"" facts extracted from corpus, in order to maintain an effective search space during path inference. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework to train two collaborative agents jointly, i.e., a multi-hop graph reasoner and a fact extractor. The fact extraction agent generates fact triples from corpora to enrich the graph on the fly; while the reasoning agent provides feedback to the fact extractor and guides it towards promoting facts that are helpful for the interpretable reasoning.

Generally, information at lower levels is more fine-grained and can be coarse-grained in higher levels. However, information processed only at specific levels seems to be available for conscious awareness. We do not have direct experience of information available at the level of individual neurons, which is noisy and highly stochastic. Neither do we have experience of more macro-level interactions such as interpersonal communications. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that conscious experiences co-vary with information encoded in coarse-grained neural states such as the firing pattern of a population of neurons. In this article, we introduce a new informational theory of consciousness: Information Closure Theory of Consciousness (ICT). We hypothesise that conscious processes are processes which form non-trivial informational closure (NTIC) with respect to the environment at certain coarse-grained levels. This hypothesis implies that conscious experience is confined due to informational closure from conscious processing to other coarse-grained levels. ICT proposes new quantitative definitions of both conscious content and conscious level. With the parsimonious definitions and a hypothesise, ICT provides explanations and predictions of various phenomena associated with consciousness. The implications of ICT naturally reconciles issues in many existing theories of consciousness and provides explanations for many of our intuitions about consciousness.

This study proposes a longitudinal framework for predicting nonresponse with machine learning and multiple panel waves and illustrates its application. With respect to model building, this approach utilizes information from multiple waves by introducing features that aggregate previous (non)response patterns. Concerning model tuning and evaluation, temporal cross-validation is employed by iterating through pairs of panel waves such that the training and test sets move in time. Implementing this approach with data from a German probability-based mixed-mode panel shows that aggregating information over multiple panel waves can be used to build prediction models with competitive and robust performance over all test waves.

Distributed Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) offers a practical solution to localize the robots without relying on an external positioning system (e.g. GPS) and with minimal information exchange. Unfortunately, current distributed SLAM systems are vulnerable to perception outliers and therefore tend to use very conservative parameters for inter-robot place recognition. However, being too conservative comes at the cost of rejecting many valid loop closure candidates, which results in less accurate trajectory estimates. This paper introduces DOOR-SLAM, a fully distributed SLAM system with an outlier rejection mechanism that can work with less conservative parameters. DOOR-SLAM is based on peer-to-peer communication and does not require full connectivity among the robots. DOOR-SLAM includes two key modules: a pose graph optimizer combined with a distributed pairwise consistent measurement set maximization algorithm to reject spurious inter-robot loop closures; and a distributed SLAM front-end that detects inter-robot loop closures without exchanging raw sensor data. The system has been evaluated in simulations, benchmarking datasets, and field experiments, including tests in GPS-denied subterranean environments. DOOR-SLAM produces more inter-robot loop closures, successfully rejects outliers, and results in accurate trajectory estimates, while requiring low communication bandwidth.

In particular, Forests dominate other methods in tabular data, that is, when the feature space is unstructured, so that the signal is invariant to a permutation of the feature indices. However, in structured data lying on a manifold (such as images, text, and speech) deep networks (Networks), specifically convolutional deep networks (ConvNets), tend to outperform Forests. We conjecture that at least part of the reason for this is that the input to Networks is not simply the feature magnitudes, but also their indices. In contrast, naive Forest implementations fail to explicitly consider feature indices. A recently proposed Forest approach demonstrates that Forests, for each node, implicitly sample a random matrix from some specific distribution. These Forests, like some classes of Networks, learn by partitioning the feature space into convex polytopes corresponding to linear functions. We build on that approach and show that one can choose distributions in a manifold-aware fashion to incorporate feature locality. We demonstrate the empirical performance on data whose features live on three different manifolds: a torus, images, and time-series. Moreover, we demonstrate its strength in multivariate simulated settings and also show superiority in predicting surgical outcome in epilepsy patients and predicting movement direction from raw stereotactic EEG data from non-motor brain regions.

This is obtained by including multiple dust fluids in a single grid-based hydrodynamic simulation and solving the Smoluchowski equation for dust coagulation on top of solving for the hydrodynamic evolution. We find that fragmentation of dust aggregates trapped in a pressure bump outside of the planetary gap leads to an enhancement in density of small grains. We compare the results obtained from the full coagulation treatment to the commonly used, fixed dust size approach and to previously applied, less computationally intensive methods for including dust coagulation.

We characterize the mass distributions of individual clusters and establish the concentration-mass (c-M) relation for the XXL sample, by accounting for selection bias and statistical effects, and marginalizing over the remaining mass calibration uncertainty. We find the mass-trend parameter of the c-M relation to be \beta = -0.07 \pm 0.28 and the normalization to be c200 = 4.8 \pm 1.0 (stat) \pm 0.8 (syst) at M200=10^{14}Msun/h and z = 0.3.

The level of intrinsic scatter in c200 is constrained as \sigma(\ln[c200]) < 24% (99.7% CL), which is smaller than predicted for the full population of LCDM halos.

The resulting Tx-M500 relation is consistent with the self-similar prediction. Our Tx-M500 relation agrees with the XXL DR1 results at group scales, but has a slightly steeper mass trend, implying a smaller mass scale in the cluster regime.

This is in contrast to the Milky Way (MW) satellites, which are generally either faint with ancient quenching times or luminous with recent ($<3$ Gyr) quenching times.

We examine recently updated distance calibrations from Cepheids, gravitational lensing time-delay observations, and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch. Calibrating the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae with combinations of the distance indicators, we obtain a joint and self-consistent measurement of $H_0$ and $r_d$ at low redshift, independent of cosmological models and CMB inference. In an attempt to alleviate the tension between late-time and CMB-based measurements, we consider four extensions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The sound horizon from our different measurements is $r_d=(137\pm3^{stat.}\pm2^{syst.})$~Mpc. Depending on the adopted distance indicators, the $combined$ tension in $H_0$ and $r_d$ ranges between 2.3 and 5.1 $\sigma$. We find that modifications of $\Lambda$CDM that change the physics after recombination fail to solve the problem, for the reason that they only resolve the tension in $H_0$, while the tension in $r_d$ remains unchanged. Pre-recombination extensions (with early dark energy or the effective number of neutrinos $\rm{N}_{\rm{eff}}=3.24 \pm 0.16$) are allowed by the data, unless the calibration from Cepheids is included. Results from time-delay lenses are consistent with those from distance-ladder calibrations and point to a discrepancy between absolute distance scales measured from the CMB (assuming the standard cosmological model) and late-time observations. New proposals to resolve this tension should be examined with respect to reconciling not only the Hubble constant but also the sound horizon derived from the CMB and other cosmological probes.

The dust is assumed to have formed in the inner region, and follows an interstellar-like dust-size distribution. Using radiative transfer modelling, we obtain dust temperature profiles for different dust types in an O-rich and a C-rich outflow. We calculate a grid of models, sampling different outflow densities, drift velocities between the dust and gas, and dust types. Dust-gas chemistry can significantly affect the gas-phase composition, depleting parent and daughter species and increasing the abundance of certain daughter species via grain-surface formation followed by desorption/sputtering. Its influence depends on four factors: outflow density, dust temperature, initial composition, and drift velocity. The largest effects are for higher density outflows with cold dust and O-rich parent species, as these species generally have a larger binding energy. At drift velocities larger than $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$, ice mantles undergo sputtering; however, they are not fully destroyed. Models with dust-gas chemistry can better reproduce the observed depletion of species in O-rich outflows. When including colder dust in the C-rich outflows and adjusting the binding energy of CS, the depletion in C-rich outflows is also better reproduced.

We see similar trends when separating galaxies by a bulge-to-total ratio based either on luminosity or stellar mass, however, the trends are more evident with luminosity. Importantly, when controlling for both stellar mass and star formation rate, the separation of atomic gas content reduces to within 0.3 dex between galaxies of different bulge-to-total ratios.

Our approach improves upon traditional methods for regulation health impact analyses by clarifying the causal identifying assumptions, utilizing population-level data, minimizing parametric assumptions, and considering the impacts of multiple pollutants simultaneously. To reduce model-dependence, the TEA estimate captures health impacts only for units in the data whose anticipated no-regulation features are within the support of the observed with-regulation data, thereby providing a conservative but data-driven assessment to complement traditional parametric approaches.

We investigate this question, via ablation studies and analysis of the latent representations, finding that feature reuse is the dominant factor.

ANIL matches MAML's performance on benchmark few-shot image classification and RL and offers computational improvements over MAML. We further study the precise contributions of the head and body of the network, showing that performance on the test tasks is entirely determined by the quality of the learned features, and we can remove even the head of the network (the NIL algorithm).

We demonstrate how an incorrect noise model can lead to spurious signals, and show how independently modeling noise across 30 Fourier components, spanning NANOGrav's frequency range, effectively diagnoses and absorbs the excess power in gravitational-wave searches. This results in a nominal, and expected, progression of our gravitational-wave statistics. Additionally we show that the first interstellar medium event in PSR J1713+0747 pollutes the common red noise process with low-spectral index noise, and use a tailored noise model to remove these effects.

This estimation of $H_0$ from standard sirens requires an accurate estimation of the cosmological redshift of the host galaxy of the GW source, after correcting for its peculiar velocity. Absence of an accurate peculiar velocity correction affects both the precision and accuracy of the measurement of $H_0$, particularly for nearby sources. We propose a framework to incorporate such a peculiar velocity correction for GW sources. A first implementation of our method to the event GW170817 combined with the Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observation leads to a revised value of $H_0= 68.3^{+ 4.6}_{-4.5}$ km/s/Mpc.

Advancements in representation learning have led to separated progress in both IR and MC; however, very few studies have examined the relationship and combined design of retrieval and comprehension at different levels of granularity, for development of MRS systems. In this work, we give general guidelines on system design for MRS by proposing a simple yet effective pipeline system with special consideration on hierarchical semantic retrieval at both paragraph and sentence level, and their potential effects on the downstream task. The system is evaluated on both fact verification and open-domain multihop QA, achieving state-of-the-art results on the leaderboard test sets of both FEVER and HOTPOTQA.

Despite being significantly shallower than most models, CORnet-S is the top model on Brain-Score and outperforms similarly compact models on ImageNet.

We study transport and thermalization in our system by observing the decay of prepared initial density waves as a function of wavelength $\lambda$ and tilt strength and find that the associated decay time $\tau$ crosses over as the tilt strength is increased from characteristically diffusive to subdiffusive with $\tau\propto\lambda^4$. In order to explain the underlying physics we develop a hydrodynamic model that exhibits this crossover. For strong tilts, the subdiffusive transport rate is set by a thermal diffusivity, which we are thus able to measure as a function of tilt in this regime. We further support our understanding by probing the local inverse temperature of the system at strong tilts, finding good agreement with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we discuss the relation of the strongly tilted limit of our system to recently studied 1D models which may exhibit nonergodic dynamics.

We present the first determination of the linear void bias measured in separate universe simulations. Our methods are validated by comparing the separate universe response bias with the clustering bias of voids. We find excellent agreement between the two methods for voids identified in the halo field and the down-sampled dark matter field. For voids traced by halos, we identify two different contributions to the bias. The first is due to the bias of the underlying halo field used to identify voids, while the second we attribute to the dynamical impact of long-wavelength density perturbations on void formation and expansion. By measuring these contributions individually, we demonstrate that their sum is consistent with the total void bias. We also measure the void profiles in our simulations, and determine their separate universe response. These can be interpreted as the sensitivity of the profiles to the background density of the Universe. ",Separate Universe Void Bias

As a result, she may feel compelled to use the feedback she receives to (re-)estimate her followers' preferences and decides which stories to share next to receive more (positive) feedback. Under which conditions can she succeed? In this work, we first look into this problem from a theoretical perspective and then provide a set of practical algorithms to identify and characterize such behavior in social media. More specifically, we address the above problem from the viewpoint of sequential decision making and utility maximization. For a wide variety of utility functions, we first show that, to succeed, a user needs to actively trade off exploitation-- sharing stories which lead to more (positive) feedback--and exploration-- sharing stories to learn about her followers' preferences. However, exploration is not necessary if a user utilizes the feedback her followers provide to other users in addition to the feedback she receives. Then, we develop a utility estimation framework for observation data, which relies on statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether a user utilizes the feedback she receives from each of her followers to decide what to post next. Experiments on synthetic data illustrate our theoretical findings and show that our estimation framework is able to accurately recover users' underlying utility functions. Experiments on several real datasets gathered from Twitter and Reddit reveal that up to 82% (43%) of the Twitter (Reddit) users in our datasets do use the feedback they receive to decide what to post next.

We first show that structural diversity correlates with user retention on Twitter, corroborating results from past observational studies. We then exogenously vary structural diversity by altering the set of network recommendations new users see when joining the platform; we confirm that this design induces the desired changes to network topology.

We first derive a general formula to estimate the clustering of PBHs with primordial non-Gaussianity without assuming the high-peak limit, and then apply this formula to a model of PBH formation in a matter-dominated epoch. Clustering is less significant in the case of the PBH formation in the matter-dominated epoch than that in the radiation-dominated epoch.

We derive a probable recurrence time of $6.2 \pm 1.2$ years and provide the ephemerides of the eclipse. In the ultraviolet-optical-IR photometry the light curve shows high variability right from the first observation around two days after eruption. Therefore no colour changes can be substantiated. Outburst spectra from 2016 and 1990 are very similar and are dominated by H and He lines longward of 2000 Angstrom. Interstellar reddening is found to be E(B-V) = $0.07\pm0.01$. The super soft X-ray luminosity is lower than the Eddington luminosity and the X-ray spectra suggest the mass of the WD is larger than 1.3 M$_\odot$. Eclipses in the light curve suggest that the system is at high orbital inclination. On day four after the eruption a recombination wave was observed in Fe II ultraviolet absorption lines. Narrow line components are seen after day 6 and explained as being due to reionisation of ejecta from a previous eruption. The UV spectrum varies with orbital phase, in particular a component of the He II 1640 Angstrom emission line, which leads us to propose that early-on the inner WD Roche lobe might be filled with a bound opaque medium prior to the re-formation of an accretion disk. Both this medium and the ejecta can cause the delay in the appearance of the soft X-ray source. ",The January 2016 eruption of recurrent nova LMC 1968

From this analysis, we propose a new set of criteria to select close pairs of galaxies along with a new corrective term to be applied to the computation of the galaxy merger fraction. We then probe the evolution of the major and minor merger fraction using the latest MUSE deep observations over the HUDF, HDFS, COSMOS-Gr30 and Abell 2744 regions.

Using the stellar mass ratio between the secondary and primary galaxy as a proxy to split the sample into major, minor and very minor mergers, we found a total of 183 major, 142 minor and 47 very minor close pairs corresponding to a mass ratio range of 1:1-1:6, 1:6-1:100 and lower than 1:100, respectively. Due to completeness issues, we do not consider the very minor pairs in the analysis. Overall, the major merger fraction increases up to $z\approx 2-3$ reaching 25% for pairs with the most massive galaxy with a stellar mass $M^*\geq 10^{9.5}M_{\odot}$. Beyond this redshift, the fraction decreases down to $\sim 5$% at $z\approx 6$. The evolution of the minor merger fraction is roughly constant with cosmic time, with a fraction of 20% at $z<3$ and a slow decrease between $3\leq z \leq6$ to 8-13%.

Specifically, our framework extends recently proposed propagation networks (PropNets) and consists of two complementary components, a physics predictor and a belief regulator. While the former predicts the future states of the object(s) manipulated by the robot, the latter constantly corrects the robot's knowledge regarding the objects and their relations. Our results showed that after training in a simulator, the robot can reliably predict the consequences of its actions in object trajectory level and exploit its own interaction experience to correct its belief about the state of the environment, enabling better predictions in partially observable environments. Furthermore, the trained model was transferred to the real world and verified in predicting trajectories of pushed interacting objects whose joint relations were initially unknown. We compared BRDPN against PropNets, and showed that BRDPN performs consistently well. Moreover, BRDPN can adapt its physic predictions, since the relations can be predicted online.

Analogous to earlier results in non-amputees, we found that their preferred walking speeds are lower for short distances and lower for circles of smaller radii. Using inverse optimization, we estimated the cost of changing speeds and turning such that the observed preferred walking speeds in our experiments minimizes the total energy cost. The inferred costs of changing speeds and turning were much larger than for non-amputees. These findings could inform prosthesis design and rehabilitation therapy to better assist changing speeds and turning tasks in amputee walking.

The study of galaxies in this redshift range is therefore important to understand early galaxy formation and the fate of galaxies at later times. Here, we investigate the burstiness of the recent star-formation history (SFH) of 221 $z\sim4.5$ main-sequence galaxies at log(M) > 9.7 by comparing their ultra-violet (UV) continuum, H$\alpha$ luminosity, and H$\alpha$ equivalent-width (EW). The H$\alpha$ properties are derived from the Spitzer [3.6$\mu$m]-[4.5$\mu$m] broad-band color, thereby properly taking into account model and photometric uncertainties. We find a significant scatter between H$\alpha$ and UV-derived luminosities and star-formation rates (SFRs). About half of the galaxies show a significant excess in H$\alpha$ compared to expectations from a constant smooth SFH. We also find a tentative anti-correlation between H$\alpha$ EW and stellar mass, ranging from 1000$\r{A}$ at log(M) < 10 to below 100$\r{A}$ at log(M) > 11. Consulting models suggests that most $z\sim4.5$ galaxies had a burst of star-formation within the last 50 Myrs, increasing their SFRs by a factor of > 5. The most massive galaxies on the other hand might decrease their SFRs, and may be transitioning to a quiescent stage by z=4. We identify differential dust attenuation (f) between stars and nebular regions as the main contributor to the uncertainty. With local galaxies selected by increasing H$\alpha$ EW (reaching values similar to high-z galaxies), we predict that f approaches unity at $z>4$ consistent with the extrapolation of measurements out to z=2.

We finally show the robustness of our energy equation, and its power to obtain physical insight into the modes. Conclusions. We have developed and benchmarked a code for the study of linear processes in planetary atmospheres, with an arbitrary steady state. The calculation of an a posteriori energy equation provides both increased robustness and physical meaning to the obtained eigenmodes. This code can be applied to various problems, and notably to further study the initial spin up of superrotation of GCM simulations of hot Jupiter.

By removing the whistler waves speed from the characteristic speeds of non-magnetic variables in the 1D Riemann solver, we are able to improve the angular momentum conservation in our test-case by one order of magnitude, while keeping the second-order numerical convergence of the scheme. We also reproduce the simulations of Tsukamoto et al. (2015) with consistent resistivities, the three non-ideal MHD effects and initial rotation, and agree with their results.

In order to model these dynamics as a branching process, whereby industries grow as a function of the availability of related or relevant skills, industry networks are typically employed. These networks, sometimes referred to as industry spaces, describe the complex structure of the capability or skill overlap between industry pairs, measured here via inter-industry labour flows. Existing models typically deploy a local or 'nearest neighbour' approach to capture the size of the labour pool available to an industry in related sectors. This approach, however, ignores higher order interactions in the network, and the presence of industry clusters or groups of industries which exhibit high internal skill overlap. We argue that these clusters represent skill basins in which workers circulate and diffuse knowledge, and delineate the size of the skilled labour force available to an industry. By applying a multi-scale community detection algorithm to this network of flows, we identify industry clusters on a range of scales, from many small clusters to few large groupings. We construct a new variable, cluster employment, which captures the workforce available to an industry within its own cluster. Using UK data we show that this variable is predictive of industry-city employment growth and, exploiting the multi-scale nature of the industrial clusters detected, propose a methodology to uncover the optimal scale at which labour pooling operates.

Through these absorption features, in principle, it is possible to infer the size distribution, composition, and structure of silicate in the interstellar medium. In particular, in this work, we investigate the magnesium and silicon K-edges. By using newly acquired synchrotron measurements, we build X-ray extinction models for fifteen dust candidates.

We do not have direct experience of information available at the level of individual neurons, which is noisy and highly stochastic. Neither do we have experience of more macro-level interactions such as interpersonal communications. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that conscious experiences co-vary with information encoded in coarse-grained neural states such as the firing pattern of a population of neurons. In this article, we introduce a new informational theory of consciousness: Information Closure Theory of Consciousness (ICT). We hypothesise that conscious processes are processes which form non-trivial informational closure (NTIC) with respect to the environment at certain coarse-grained levels. This hypothesis implies that conscious experience is confined due to informational closure from conscious processing to other coarse-grained levels. ICT proposes new quantitative definitions of both conscious content and conscious level. With the parsimonious definitions and a hypothesise, ICT provides explanations and predictions of various phenomena associated with consciousness.

Indeed, experimental and field research has provided mounting evidence of chaos in species' abundances, especially for discrete-time systems. Discrete-time dynamics, mainly arising in boreal and temperate ecosystems for species with non-overlapping generations, have been largely studied to understand the dynamical outcomes due to changes in relevant ecological parameters. The local and global dynamical behaviour of many of these models is difficult to investigate analytically in the parameter space and, typically, numerical approaches are employed when the dimension of the phase space is large. In this article we provide topological and dynamical results for a map modelling a discrete-time, three-species food chain with two predator species interacting on the same prey population. The domain where dynamics live is characterized, as well as the so-called escaping regions, for which the species go rapidly to extinction after surpassing the carrying capacity. We also provide a full description of the local stability of equilibria within a volume of the parameter space given by the prey's growth rate and the predation rates. We have found that the increase of the pressure of predators on the prey results in chaos. The entry into chaos is achieved via a supercritical Neimarck-Sacker bifurcation followed by period-doubling bifurcations of invariant curves. Interestingly, an increasing predation directly on preys can shift the extinction of top predators to their survival, allowing an unstable persistence of the three species by means of periodic and strange chaotic attractors.

To get the best of both worlds, we introduce the scaling-binning calibrator, which first fits a parametric function to reduce variance and then bins the function values to actually ensure calibration. This requires only $O(1/\epsilon^2 + B)$ samples. Next, we show that we can estimate a model's calibration error more accurately using an estimator from the meteorological community---or equivalently measure its calibration error with fewer samples ($O(\sqrt{B})$ instead of $O(B)$).

The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we introduce a new dataset consisting of 250 videos related to prostate cancer manually annotated for misinformation. Second, we explore the use of linguistic, acoustic, and user engagement features for the development of classification models to identify misinformation.

We claim that contextualizing BBPE embeddings is necessary, which can be implemented by a convolutional or recurrent layer.

DocRepair performs automatic post-editing on a sequence of sentence-level translations, refining translations of sentences in context of each other. For training, the DocRepair model requires only monolingual document-level data in the target language. It is trained as a monolingual sequence-to-sequence model that maps inconsistent groups of sentences into consistent ones. The consistent groups come from the original training data; the inconsistent groups are obtained by sampling round-trip translations for each isolated sentence. We show that this approach successfully imitates inconsistencies we aim to fix: using contrastive evaluation, we show large improvements in the translation of several contextual phenomena in an English-Russian translation task, as well as improvements in the BLEU score. We also conduct a human evaluation and show a strong preference of the annotators to corrected translations over the baseline ones. Moreover, we analyze which discourse phenomena are hard to capture using monolingual data only. ",Context-Aware Monolingual Repair for Neural Machine Translation

Hamiltonians are the main tool for modelling the continuous time evolution of systems with conserved quantities, and they come equipped with many useful properties, like time reversibility and smooth interpolation in time. These properties are important for many machine learning problems - from sequence prediction to reinforcement learning and density modelling - but are not typically provided out of the box by standard tools such as recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we introduce the Hamiltonian Generative Network (HGN), the first approach capable of consistently learning Hamiltonian dynamics from high-dimensional observations (such as images) without restrictive domain assumptions. Once trained, we can use HGN to sample new trajectories, perform rollouts both forward and backward in time and even speed up or slow down the learned dynamics. We demonstrate how a simple modification of the network architecture turns HGN into a powerful normalising flow model, called Neural Hamiltonian Flow (NHF), that uses Hamiltonian dynamics to model expressive densities. We hope that our work serves as a first practical demonstration of the value that the Hamiltonian formalism can bring to deep learning. ",Hamiltonian Generative Networks

Finally, we devise a full-fledged evaluation framework in which we couple existing bias metrics with newly proposed ones. Experimental findings across three embedding methods suggest that the proposed debiasing models are robust and widely applicable: they often completely remove the bias both implicitly and explicitly without degradation of semantic information encoded in any of the input distributional spaces.
