In this paper we investigate a sample of 29 well-characterized brown dwarfs and very low mass stars, for which Herschel far-infrared fluxes as well as (sub)-mm fluxes are available. We have measured new Herschel PACS fluxes for 11 objects and complement these with (sub)-mm data and Herschel fluxes from the literature. We analyze their spectral energy distributions in comparison with results from radiative transfer modeling. Fluxes in the far-infrared are strongly affected by the shape and temperature of the disk (and hence stellar luminosity), whereas the (sub)-mm fluxes mostly depend on disk mass. Nevertheless, there is a clear correlation between far-infrared and (sub)-mm fluxes. We argue that the link results from the combination of the stellar mass-luminosity relation and a scaling between disk mass and stellar mass. We find strong evidence of dust settling to the disk midplane. The spectral slopes between near- and far-infrared are mostly between $-0.5$ and $-1.2$ in our sample, comparable to more massive T Tauri stars, which may imply that the disk shapes are similar as well, though highly-flared disks are rare among brown dwarfs. We find that dust temperatures in the range of 7-15 K, calculated with $T\approx25\,(L/L_\odot)^{0.25}$ K, are appropriate for deriving disk masses from (sub)-mm fluxes for these low luminosity objects. About half of our sample hosts disks with at least one Jupiter mass, confirming that many brown dwarfs harbour sufficient material for the formation of Earth-mass planets in their midst.

At variance with other Low Mass X-ray binaries, this active state reaches luminosities of only ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, showing strong, fast variability. In the active state, J1023 displays: i) a high state ($L_X\sim7\times10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$, 0.3-80 keV) occurring ~80% of the time and during which X-ray pulsations at the neutron star spin period are detected (pulsed fraction ~8%); ii) a low state ($L_X~10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$) during which pulsations are not detected (~<3%); and iii) a flaring state during which sporadic flares occur in excess of ~$10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with no pulsation too. The transition between the high and the low states is very rapid, on a ~10 s timescale. Here we put forward a plausible physical interpretation of the high and low states based on the (fast) transition among the propeller state and the radio pulsar state.

Standard calibrations (such as for the star formation rate) are not applicable to such composite (mixed) spectra. In this paper, we describe how integral field data can be used to spectrally and spatially separate emission associated with star formation from emission associated with accretion onto an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We demonstrate our method using integral field data for two AGN host galaxies (NGC 5728 and NGC 7679) from the Siding Spring Southern Seyfert Spectroscopic Snapshot Survey (S7). The spectra of NGC 5728 and NGC 7679 form clear sequences of AGN fraction on standard emission line ratio diagnostic diagrams. We show that the emission line luminosities of the majority (> 85 per cent) of spectra along each AGN fraction sequence can be reproduced by linear superpositions of the emission line luminosities of one AGN dominated spectrum and one star formation dominated spectrum.

We present a new framework for improving object detection in videos that captures temporal context and encourages consistency of predictions. First, we train a pseudo-labeler, that is, a domain-adapted convolutional neural network for object detection. The pseudo-labeler is first trained individually on the subset of labeled frames, and then subsequently applied to all frames. Then we train a recurrent neural network that takes as input sequences of pseudo-labeled frames and optimizes an objective that encourages both accuracy on the target frame and consistency across consecutive frames. The approach incorporates strong supervision of target frames, weak-supervision on context frames, and regularization via a smoothness penalty.

Here we demonstrate that tradeoffs between aggressiveness and defensiveness (i.e., targeting adversaries vs. targeting like-minded individuals) creates paradoxical behaviour such as non-transitive dynamics. And while there is an optimal strategy in a two competitor system, three competitor systems have no such solution; the introduction of extreme strategies can easily affect the outcome of a competition, even if the extreme strategies have no chance of winning. Not only are these results reminiscent of classic paradoxical results from evolutionary game theory, but the structure of social networks created by our model can be mapped to particular forms of payoff matrices.

Random projections are a simple, powerful tool for dimensionality reduction of such data. Previous works have studied bounds on how many projections are needed to accurately preserve the geometry of these manifolds, given their intrinsic dimensionality, volume and curvature. However, such works employ definitions of volume and curvature that are inherently difficult to compute. Therefore such theory cannot be easily tested against numerical simulations to understand the tightness of the proven bounds. We instead study typical distortions arising in random projections of an ensemble of smooth Gaussian random manifolds. We find explicitly computable, approximate theoretical bounds on the number of projections required to accurately preserve the geometry of these manifolds. Our bounds, while approximate, can only be violated with a probability that is exponentially small in the ambient dimension, and therefore they hold with high probability in cases of practical interest. Moreover, unlike previous work, we test our theoretical bounds against numerical experiments on the actual geometric distortions that typically occur for random projections of random smooth manifolds.

Instead, the plane that contains Cen A becomes more prominent. We found evidence that the galaxy system around Cen A is made up of only one plane of satellites.

We use the 20k zCOSMOS-bright spectroscopic survey to select bona fide quiescent galaxies at 0.2<z<0.8. We stack their spectra in bins of redshift, stellar mass and size to compute stellar population parameters in these bins through fits to the rest-frame optical spectra and through Lick spectral indices. We confirm a change of behaviour in the size-age relation below and above the ~10^11 MSun stellar mass scale: In our 10.5 < log M*/MSun < 11 mass bin, over the entire redshift window, the stellar populations of the largest galaxies are systematically younger than those of the smaller counterparts, pointing at progenitor bias as the main driver of the observed average size evolution at sub-10^11 MSun masses. In contrast, at higher masses, there is no clear trend in age as a function of galaxy size, supporting a substantial role of dry mergers in increasing the sizes of these most massive QGs with cosmic time. Within the errors, the [alpha/Fe] abundance ratios of QGs are (i) above-solar over the entire redshift range of our analysis, hinting at universally short timescales for the buildup of the stellar populations of QGs, and (ii) similar at all masses and sizes, suggesting similar (short) timescales for the whole QG population and strengthening the role of mergers in the buildup of the most massive QGs in the Universe.

Much less attention has been paid to the construction of these networks. We point out that different approaches can be taken to construct a bibliometric network. Normally the full counting approach is used, but we propose an alternative fractional counting approach. The basic idea of the fractional counting approach is that each action, such as co-authoring or citing a publication, should have equal weight, regardless of for instance the number of authors, citations, or references of a publication. We present two empirical analyses in which the full and fractional counting approaches yield very different results. These analyses deal with co-authorship networks of universities and bibliographic coupling networks of journals. Based on theoretical considerations and on the empirical analyses, we conclude that for many purposes the fractional counting approach is preferable over the full counting one.

We consider BNSs producing a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that collapses to a spinning black hole (BH) surrounded by a magnetized accretion disk in a few tens of ms. We investigate whether such systems may launch relativistic jets and power short gamma-ray bursts. We study the effects of different equations of state (EOSs), different mass ratios, and different magnetic field orientations. For all cases, we present a detailed investigation of the matter dynamics and of the magnetic field evolution, with particular attention to its global structure and possible emission of relativistic jets. The main result of this work is that we found the formation of an organized magnetic field structure. This happens independently of EOS, mass ratio, and initial magnetic field orientation. We also show that those models that produce a longer-lived HMNS lead to a stronger magnetic field before collapse to BH. Such larger fields make it possible, for at least one of our models, to resolve the MRI and hence further amplify the magnetic field. However, by the end of our simulations, we do not observe a magnetically dominated funnel and hence neither a relativistic outflow. With respect to the recent simulations of Ruiz et al 2016, we evolve models with lower and more realistic initial magnetic field strengths and, because of computational reasons, we do not evolve the accretion disk for the long timescales that seem to be required in order to see a relativistic outflow. Since all our models produce a similar ordered magnetic field structure, we expect that the results found in Ruiz et al 2016, where they only considered an equal-mass system with an ideal fluid EOS, should be general and, at least from a qualitative point of view, independent from mass-ratio, magnetic field orientation, and EOS.

The simulations model the interaction between a hot wind driven by supernova explosions and a cooler, denser cloud of interstellar or circumgalactic media. By resolving scales of $\Delta x<0.1$ pc over $>100$ pc distances our calculations capture how the cloud disruption leads to a distribution of densities and temperatures in the resulting multiphase outflow, and quantify the mass and momentum associated with each phase. We find the multiphase wind contains comparable mass and momenta in phases over a wide range of densities and temperatures extending from the hot wind ($n \approx 10^{-2.5}$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $T \approx 10^{6.5}$ K) to the coldest components ($n \approx 10^2$ $\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, $T \approx 10^2$ K). We further find that the momentum distributes roughly in proportion to the mass in each phase, and the mass-loading of the hot phase by the destruction of cold, dense material is an efficient process. These results provide new insight into the physical origin of observed multiphase galactic outflows, and inform galaxy formation models that include coarser treatments of galactic winds. Our results confirm that cool gas observed in outflows at large distances from the galaxy ($\gtrsim1$kpc) likely does not originate through the entrainment of cold material near the central starburst.

Most theoretical efforts focus on key aspects of open-ended evolution as it appears in biology. We recast the problem as a more general one in dynamical systems theory, providing simple criteria for open-ended evolution based on two hallmark features: unbounded evolution and innovation. We define unbounded evolution as patterns that are non-repeating within the expected Poincare recurrence time of an equivalent isolated system, and innovation as trajectories not observed in isolated systems. As a case study, we implement novel variants of cellular automata (CA) in which the update rules are allowed to vary with time in three alternative ways. Each is capable of generating conditions for open-ended evolution, but vary in their ability to do so. We find that state-dependent dynamics, widely regarded as a hallmark of life, statistically out-performs other candidate mechanisms, and is the only mechanism to produce open-ended evolution in a scalable manner, essential to the notion of ongoing evolution. This analysis suggests a new framework for unifying mechanisms for generating OEE with features distinctive to life and its artifacts, with broad applicability to biological and artificial systems.

It is constructed for gaseous chemistry from 500 to 2500 K using a reduced C-H-O chemical network with about 300 reactions. It uses eddy diffusion to mimic atmospheric dynamics and excludes photochemistry. We have provided a full description of the rate coefficients and thermodynamic data used. We validate VULCAN by reproducing chemical equilibrium and by comparing its output versus the disequilibrium-chemistry calculations of Moses et al. and Rimmer & Helling. It reproduces the models of HD 189733b and HD 209458b by Moses et al., which employ a network with nearly 1600 reactions. We also use VULCAN to examine the theoretical trends produced when the temperature-pressure profile and carbon-to-oxygen ratio are varied. Assisted by a sensitivity test designed to identify the key reactions responsible for producing a specific molecule, we revisit the quenching approximation and find that it is accurate for methane but breaks down for acetylene, because the disequilibrium abundance of acetylene is not directly determined by transport-induced quenching, but is rather indirectly controlled by the disequilibrium abundance of methane. Therefore, we suggest that the quenching approximation should be used with caution and must always be checked against a chemical kinetics calculation. A one-dimensional model atmosphere with 100 layers, computed using VULCAN, typically takes several minutes to complete.

The directly imaged exoplanet or brown dwarf companion joins a small but growing ensemble of wide-orbit sub-stellar companions with a spin measurement. The GQ Lupi system was observed at high spectral resolution (R ~ 100000), and in the analysis we made use of both spectral and spatial filtering to separate the signal of the companion from that of the host star. We detect both CO (S/N=11.6) and H2O (S/N=7.7) in the atmosphere of GQ Lupi b by cross-correlating with model spectra, and we find it to be a slow rotator with a projected rotational velocity of $5.3^{+0.9}_{-1.0}$ km/s. The slow rotation is most likely due to its young age of < 5 Myr, as it is still in the process of accreting material and angular momentum. We measure the barycentric radial velocity of GQ Lupi b to be $2.0 \pm 0.4$ km/s, and discuss the allowed orbital configurations and their implications for formation scenarios for GQ Lupi b.

Recently Tully et al. (2015) reported the discovery of two almost parallel planes in the nearby Cen A group using mostly high-mass galaxies (M$_B$ $<$ -10 mag) in their analysis. Our team detected a large number of new group member candidates in the Cen A group (M\""uller et al. 2016). This dwarf galaxy sample combined with other recent results from the literature enables us to test the galaxy distribution in the direction of the Cen A group and to determine the statistical significance of the geometric alignment. Taking advantage of the fact that the two galaxy planes lie almost edge-on along the line of sight, the newly found 13 group members by Crnojevic et al. (2014, 2016) and our 16 new Cen A group candidates (M\""uller et al. 2016) can be assigned relative to the two planes. We use various statistical methods to test whether the distribution of galaxies follows a single normal distribution or shows evidence of bimodality as it has been reported earlier. We confirm that the data used for the Tully et al. (2015) study support the picture of a bimodal structure. However, when the new galaxy samples are included, the gap between the two galaxy planes is closing and the significance level of the bimodality is reduced. Instead, the plane that contains Cen A becomes more prominent. We found evidence that the galaxy system around Cen A is made up of only one plane of satellites. This plane is almost orthogonal to the dust plane of Cen A. Accurate distances to the new dwarf galaxies will be required to measure the precise 3D distribution of the galaxies around Cen A.
