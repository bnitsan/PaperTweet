The robot is capable of obtaining noisy measurements of the target's position. The key idea in active target tracking is to choose control laws that drive the robot to measurement locations that will reduce the uncertainty in the target's position. The challenge is that measurement uncertainty often is a function of the (unknown) relative positions of the target and the robot. Consequently, a closed-loop control policy is desired which can map the current estimate of the target's position to an optimal control law for the robot. Our main contribution is to devise a closed-loop control policy for target tracking that plans for a sequence of control actions, instead of acting greedily. We consider scenarios where the noise in measurement is a function of the state of the target. We seek to minimize the maximum uncertainty (trace of the posterior covariance matrix) over all possible measurements. We exploit the structural properties of a Kalman Filter to build a policy tree that is orders of magnitude smaller than naive enumeration while still preserving optimality guarantees. We show how to obtain even more computational savings by relaxing the optimality guarantees. The resulting algorithms are evaluated through simulations.

During training, our model learns to encode the flow from one expression to another over a low-dimensional latent space. At test time, expression editing can be done simply using latent vector arithmetic. We evaluate our methods on two applications: 1) single-image facial expression editing, and 2) facial expression interpolation between two images.

This rather surprising event, occurring at an unexpected latitude and time, is the sixth ""Great White Spot"" (GWS) storm observed over the last century and a half. Such GWS events are planetary-scale atmospheric phenomena that dramatically change the typically bland appearance of the planet. Occurring while the Cassini mission was on-orbit at Saturn, the Great Storm of 2010-2011 was well-suited for intense scrutiny by the suite of sophisticated instruments onboard the Cassini spacecraft as well by modern instrumentation on ground-based telescopes and onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. This GWS erupted on December 5th and generated a major dynamical disturbance that affected the whole latitude band from 25 deg to 48 deg N. Lightning events were prominent and detected as outbursts and flashes at both optical and radio wavelengths. The activity of the head ceased after about seven months, leaving the cloud structure and ambient winds perturbed. The tops of the optically dense clouds of the storm's head reached the 300 mbar altitude level where a mixture of ices was detected. The energetics of the frequency and power of lightning, as well as the estimated power generated by the latent heat released in the water-based convection, both indicate that the power released for the storm was a significant fraction of Saturn's total radiated power. The effects of the storm propagated into the stratosphere forming two warm airmasses at the 0.5-5 mbar pressure level altitude. Related to the stratospheric disturbance, hydrocarbon composition excesses were found. The decades-long interval between storms is probably related to the insolation cycle and the long radiative time constant of Saturn's atmosphere, and several theories for temporarily storing energy have been proposed.

Here, we assess these results by measuring the stellar kinematics on a sample of 315 galaxies, without a morphological selection, using 2D integral field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. A proxy for the spin parameter ($\lambda_{R_e}$) and ellipticity ($\epsilon_e$) are used to separate fast and slow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regular rotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies. We confirm that regular rotators show a strong h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation, whereas quasi-regular and non-regular rotators show a more vertical relation in h3 and $V/\sigma$. Motivated by recent cosmological simulations, we develop an alternative approach to kinematically classify galaxies from their individual h3 versus $V/\sigma$ signatures. We identify five classes of high-order stellar kinematic signatures using Gaussian mixture models. Class 1 corresponds to slow rotators, whereas Classes 2-5 correspond to fast rotators. We find that galaxies with similar $\lambda_{R_e}-\epsilon_e$ values can show distinctly different h3-$V/\sigma$ signatures. Class 5 objects are previously unidentified fast rotators that show a weak h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation. These objects are predicted to be disk-less galaxies formed by gas-poor mergers. From morphological examination, however, there is evidence for large stellar disks. Instead, Class 5 objects are more likely disturbed galaxies, have counter-rotating bulges, or bars in edge-on galaxies. Finally, we interpret the strong anti-correlation in h3 versus $V/\sigma$ as evidence for disks in most fast rotators, suggesting a dearth of gas-poor mergers among fast rotators.

In spatial dimension $n=2$, it is known that the number of critical points (where $\nabla u=0$) is related to the number of oscillations of the boundary condition independently of the (positive) coefficient $\sigma$. We show that the situation is different in dimension $n\geq3$. More precisely, we obtain that for any fixed (Dirichlet or Neumann) boundary condition for $u$ on $\partial X$, there exists an open set of smooth coefficients $\sigma(x)$ such that $\nabla u$ vanishes at least at one point in $X$. By using estimates related to the Laplacian with mixed boundary conditions, the result is first obtained for a piecewise constant conductivity with infinite contrast, a problem of independent interest. A second step shows that the topology of the vector field $\nabla u$ on a subdomain is not modified for appropriate bounded, sufficiently high-contrast, smooth coefficients $\sigma(x)$. These results find applications in the class of hybrid inverse problems, where optimal stability estimates for parameter reconstruction are obtained in the absence of critical points. Our results show that for any (finite number of) prescribed boundary conditions, there are coefficients $\sigma(x)$ for which the stability of the reconstructions will inevitably degrade.

The backbone of the proposed method is the Incremental Mixture Importance Sampling (IMIS) algorithm of Raftery and Bao (2010), which builds a mixture importance distribution incrementally, by positioning new mixture components where the importance density lacks mass, relative to the target. The key innovation proposed here is that the mixture components used by IMIS are local approximations to the target density. In particular, their mean vectors and covariance matrices are constructed by numerically solving certain differential equations, whose solution depends on the gradient field of the target log-density. The new sampler has a number of advantages: a) it provides an extremely parsimonious parametrization of the mixture importance density, whose configuration effectively depends only on the shape of the target and on a single free parameter representing pseudo-time; b) it scales well with the dimensionality of the target; c) it can deal with targets that are not log- concave. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a synthetic non-Gaussian multimodal density, defined on up to eighty dimensions, and on a Bayesian logistic regression model, using the Sonar data-set.

Indeed, information routing in the Internet faces serious scalability problems due to its rapid growth, recently accelerated by the rise of the Internet of Things. Large networks like the Internet can be navigated efficiently if nodes, or agents, actively forward information based on hidden maps underlying these systems. However, in reality most agents will deny to forward messages, which has a cost, and navigation is impossible. Can we design appropriate incentives that lead to participation and global navigability? Here, we present an evolutionary game where agents share the value generated by successful delivery of information or goods. We show that global navigability can emerge, but its complete breakdown is possible as well. Furthermore, we show that the system tends to self-organize into local clusters of agents who participate in the navigation.

For a given parameter value, we estimate the probability of the rare event that the latent variables correspond to data roughly consistent with the observations.

Color-avoiding percolation provides a theoretical framework for analyzing this scenario, focusing on the maximal set of nodes which can be connected via multiple color-avoiding paths. In this paper we extend the basic theory of color-avoiding percolation that was published in [Krause et. al., Phys. Rev. X 6 (2016) 041022]. We explicitly account for the fact that the same particular link can be part of different paths avoiding different colors. This fact was previously accounted for with a heuristic approximation. We compare this approximation with a new, more exact theory and show that the new theory is substantially more accurate for many avoided colors. Further, we formulate our new theory with differentiated node functions, as senders/receivers or as transmitters. In both functions, nodes can be explicitly trusted or avoided. With only one avoided color we obtain standard percolation. With one by one avoiding additional colors, we can understand the critical behavior of color avoiding percolation. For heterogeneous color frequencies, we find that the colors with the largest frequencies control the critical threshold and exponent. Colors of small frequencies have only a minor influence on color avoiding connectivity, thus allowing for approximations. ",Color-avoiding percolation

Background subtraction is applied to extract moving objects and get their scale and size in combination with KCF outputs, while KCF is used for data association and to handle fragmentation and occlusion problems. As a result, KCF and background subtraction help each other to take tracking decision at every frame. Sometimes KCF outputs are the most trustworthy (e.g. during occlusion), while in some other case, it is the background subtraction outputs. To validate the effectiveness of our system, the algorithm is demonstrated on four urban video recordings from a standard dataset.

This problem is typically formulated as a maximum-likelihood estimation that requires solving a nonconvex nonlinear program, which is computationally intractable in general. Nevertheless, in this paper we present an algorithm that is able to efficiently recover certifiably globally optimal solutions of this estimation problem in a non-adversarial noise regime. The crux of our approach is the development of a semidefinite relaxation of the maximum-likelihood estimation whose minimizer provides the exact MLE so long as the magnitude of the noise corrupting the available measurements falls below a certain critical threshold; furthermore, whenever exactness obtains, it is possible to verify this fact a posteriori, thereby certifying the optimality of the recovered estimate. We develop a specialized optimization scheme for solving large-scale instances of this semidefinite relaxation by exploiting its low-rank, geometric, and graph-theoretic structure to reduce it to an equivalent optimization problem on a low-dimensional Riemannian manifold, and then design a Riemannian truncated-Newton trust-region method to solve this reduction efficiently. We combine this fast optimization approach with a simple rounding procedure to produce our algorithm, SE-Sync. Experimental evaluation on a variety of simulated and real-world pose-graph SLAM datasets shows that SE-Sync is capable of recovering globally optimal solutions when the available measurements are corrupted by noise up to an order of magnitude greater than that typically encountered in robotics applications, and does so at a computational cost that scales comparably with that of direct Newton-type local search techniques.

Especially dangerous is crypto ransomware that encrypts important user data and it is only possible to recover it once a ransom has been paid. Therefore devising efficient and effective countermeasures is a rising necessity. In this paper we present a novel Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based detection approach that utilizes characteristics of ransomware communication. Based on the observation of network communication of two crypto ransomware families, namely CryptoWall and Locky we conclude that analysis of the HTTP messages' sequences and their respective content sizes is enough to detect such threats. We show feasibility of our approach by designing and evaluating the proof-of-concept SDN-based detection system. Experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is feasible and efficient.

This gives rise to an approximation that inherits the benefits of the variational approach but with the representational power and computational scalability of spectral representations. The work hinges on a key result that there exist spectral features related to a finite domain of the Gaussian process which exhibit almost-independent covariances. We derive these expressions for Matern kernels in one dimension, and generalize to more dimensions using kernels with specific structures. Under the assumption of additive Gaussian noise, our method requires only a single pass through the dataset, making for very fast and accurate computation. We fit a model to 4 million training points in just a few minutes on a standard laptop. With non-conjugate likelihoods, our MCMC scheme reduces the cost of computation from O(NM2) (for a sparse Gaussian process) to O(NM) per iteration, where N is the number of data and M is the number of features.

We introduce quasi-recurrent neural networks (QRNNs), an approach to neural sequence modeling that alternates convolutional layers, which apply in parallel across timesteps, and a minimalist recurrent pooling function that applies in parallel across channels. Despite lacking trainable recurrent layers, stacked QRNNs have better predictive accuracy than stacked LSTMs of the same hidden size. Due to their increased parallelism, they are up to 16 times faster at train and test time. Experiments on language modeling, sentiment classification, and character-level neural machine translation demonstrate these advantages and underline the viability of QRNNs as a basic building block for a variety of sequence tasks.
