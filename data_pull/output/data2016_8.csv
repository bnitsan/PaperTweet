We study the task of sampling from the output distributions of (pseudo-)random quantum circuits, a natural task for benchmarking quantum computers. Crucially, sampling this distribution classically requires a direct numerical simulation of the circuit, with computational cost exponential in the number of qubits. This requirement is typical of chaotic systems. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue more formally that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We study the convergence to the chaotic regime using extensive supercomputer simulations, modeling circuits with up to 42 qubits - the largest quantum circuits simulated to date for a computational task that approaches quantum supremacy. We argue that while chaotic states are extremely sensitive to errors, quantum supremacy can be achieved in the near-term with approximately fifty superconducting qubits. We introduce cross entropy as a useful benchmark of quantum circuits which approximates the circuit fidelity. We show that the cross entropy can be efficiently measured when circuit simulations are available. Beyond the classically tractable regime, the cross entropy can be extrapolated and compared with theoretical estimates of circuit fidelity to define a practical quantum supremacy test.

We quantify the density and velocity structure of the interstellar medium using power spectra and compare the simulated galaxies to observed HI in local spiral galaxies from THINGS (The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey). Our models with stellar feedback give an excellent match to the observed THINGS HI density power spectra. We find that kinetic energy power spectra in feedback regulated galaxies, regardless of galaxy mass and size, show scalings in excellent agreement with super-sonic turbulence ($E(k)\propto k^{-2}$) on scales below the thickness of the HI layer. We show that feedback influences the gas density field, and drives gas turbulence, up to large (kpc) scales. This is in stark contrast to density fields generated by large scale gravity-only driven turbulence. We conclude that the neutral gas content of galaxies carries signatures of stellar feedback on all scales. ","The impact of stellar feedback on the density and velocity structure of

Local measurements of the PSFs are given by the isolated stars images. Yet, these estimates may not be directly usable for post-processings because of the observational noise and potentially the aliasing. Aims: given a set of aliased and noisy stars images from a telescope, we want to estimate well-resolved and noise-free PSFs at the observed stars positions, in particular, exploiting the spatial correlation of the PSFs across the FOV. Contributions: we introduce RCA (Resolved Components Analysis) which is a noise-robust dimension reduction and super-resolution method based on matrix factorization. We propose an original way of using the PSFs spatial correlation in the restoration process through sparsity. The introduced formalism can be applied to correlated data sets with respect to any euclidean parametric space. Results: we tested our method on simulated monochromatic PSFs of Euclid telescope (launch planned for 2020). The proposed method outperforms existing PSFs restoration and dimension reduction methods. We show that a coupled sparsity constraint on individual PSFs and their spatial distribution yields a significant improvement on both the restored PSFs shapes and the PSFs subspace identification, in presence of aliasing. Perspectives: RCA can be naturally extended to account for the wavelength dependency of the PSFs. ",Constraint matrix factorization for space variant PSFs field restoration

Specifically, dynamic languages permit software that is richly extensible (via dynamic code loading, dynamic object extension, and various forms of reflection), and today's programmers exploit this flexibility to ""bring their own language features"" to enrich extensible languages (e.g., by using common JavaScript libraries). Meanwhile, such library-based language extensions generally lack enforcement of their abstractions, leading to programming errors that are complex to avoid and predict. To offer verification for this extensible world, we propose online verification-validation (OVV), which consists of language and VM design that enables a ""phaseless"" approach to program analysis, in contrast to the standard static-dynamic phase distinction. Phaseless analysis freely interposes abstract interpretation with concrete execution, allowing analyses to use dynamic (concrete) information to prove universal (abstract) properties about future execution. In this paper, we present a conceptual overview of OVV through a motivating example program that uses a hypothetical database library. We present a generic semantics for OVV, and an extension to this semantics that offers a simple gradual type system for the database library primitives. The result of instantiating this gradual type system in an OVV setting is a checker that can progressively type successive continuations of the program until a continuation is fully verified. To evaluate the proposed vision of OVV for this example, we implement the VM semantics (in Rust), and show that this design permits progressive typing in this manner.

The differences in Pt-Pt binding strength between edge atoms on the various facets were found to play a significant role in step edge wandering and reconstruction events.

This general task is called community detection in networks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data. It is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by their ability to find so-called ""ground truth"" communities. This works well in synthetic networks with planted communities because such networks' links are formed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no planted communities in real world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to treat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground truth. Here, we show that metadata are not the same as ground truth, and that treating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We prove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a general No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks. However, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still have value so a careful exploration of their relationship with network structure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by introducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship between metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We demonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and for multiple types of metadata and community structure.

This suggests that Hercules may be dissolving under the Milky Way's gravitational influence, and hence could be a tidal stream in formation rather than a bound, dark-matter dominated satellite. Using Bayesian inference in combination with N-body simulations, we show that Hercules has to be on a very eccentric orbit (epsilon~0.95) within the Milky Way in this scenario. On such an orbit, Hercules ""explodes"" as a consequence of the last tidal shock at pericenter 0.5 Gyr ago. It is currently decelerating towards apocenter of its orbit with a velocity of V=157 km/s -- of which 99% is directed radially outwards. Due to differential orbital precession caused by the non-spherical nature of the Galactic potential, its debris fans out nearly perpendicular to its orbit. This explains why Hercules has an elongated shape without showing a distance gradient along its main body: it is in fact a stream that is significantly broader than it is long. In other words, it is moving perpendicular to its apparent major axis. In this scenario, there is a spike in the radial velocity profile created by the dominant debris component that formed through the last pericenter passage. This is similar to kinematic substructure that is observed in the real Hercules. Modeling a satellite on such a highly eccentric orbit is strongly dependent on the form of the Galactic potential. We therefore propose that detailed kinematic investigation of Hercules and other exploding satellite candidates can yield strong constraints on the potential of the Milky Way.

One of the most important effects measured by both the static dielectric and quadrupolar susceptibility is the ability to screen charges embedded in the fluid.

In the limit of weak nonlinearity this precession frequency is simply due to the linear 'drift' of the triad phase; therefore, it tends toward the detuning. This means precession resonance of this type can occur at finite amplitudes, with nonlinear corrections contributing to the resonance.

The method is based on the correlation between different measurements of angular diameter, used as a proxy for atmospheric extension, and fundamental stellar parameters. For a given star, spectrophotometry measures the Rosseland angular diameter while interferometric observations generally probe a larger limb-darkened angular diameter. The ratio of these two angular diameters is proportional to the relative extension of the stellar atmosphere, which is strongly correlated to the star's effective temperature, radius and mass.

This approach leverages the simplicity of real-time Walsh-function generation in classical digital hardware, and the fact that a wide variety of physical-layer controls such as dynamic error suppression are known to fall within the Walsh family. We experimentally implement a real-time FPGA-based Walsh controller producing Walsh timing signals and Walsh-synthesized analog waveforms appropriate for critical tasks in error-resistant quantum control and noise characterization. These demonstrations represent the first step towards a unified framework for the realization of physical-layer controls compatible with large-scale quantum information processing.

The subsequent thermo-mechanical evolution, such as internal differentiation or rapid volatile degassing, yields important implications for the final structure, composition and evolution of terrestrial planets. SLR-driven heating in the Solar System is sensitive to the absolute abundance and homogeneity of SLRs within the protoplanetary disk present during the condensation of the first solids. In order to explain the diverse compositions found for extrasolar planets, it is important to understand the distribution of SLRs in active planet formation regions (star clusters) during their first few Myr of evolution. By constraining the range of possible effects, we show how the imprint of SLRs can be extrapolated to exoplanetary systems and derive statistical predictions for the distribution of aluminum-26 and iron-60 based on N-body simulations of typical to large clusters (1000-10000 stars) with a range of initial conditions. We quantify the pollution of protoplanetary disks by supernova ejecta and show that the likelihood of enrichment levels similar to or higher than the Solar System can vary considerably, depending on the cluster morphology. Furthermore, many enriched systems show an excess in radiogenic heating compared to Solar System levels, which implies that the formation and evolution of planetesimals could vary significantly depending on the birth environment of their host stars.

We provide a best fitting model, as well as estimates of the properties of the Milky Way. Under the assumptions in our main model, we find that the Sun is $R_0 = (8.20\pm0.09)\,\mathrm{kpc}$ from the Galactic Centre, with the circular speed at the Sun being $v_0 = (232.8\pm3.0)\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$; that the Galaxy has a total stellar mass of $(54.3\pm5.7)\times10^9\,{\rm M}_\odot$, a total virial mass of $(1.30 \pm 0.30)\times10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ and a local dark-matter density of $0.38\pm0.04\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm}^{-3}$, where the quoted uncertainties are statistical. These values are sensitive to our choice of priors and constraints. We investigate systematic uncertainties, which in some cases may be larger. For example, if we weaken our prior on $R_0$, we find it to be $(7.97\pm0.15)\,\mathrm{kpc}$ and that $v_0=(226.8\pm4.2)\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

In this work, we describe property testing algorithms for sparsity that observe a low-dimensional projection of the input. We consider two settings. In the first setting, for a given design matrix A in R^{d x m}, we test whether an input vector y in R^d equals Ax for some k-sparse unit vector x. Our algorithm projects the input onto O(k \eps^{-2} log m) dimensions, accepts if the property holds, rejects if ||y - Ax|| > \eps for any O(k/\eps^2)-sparse vector x, and runs in time polynomial in m. Our algorithm is based on the approximate Caratheodory's theorem. Previously known algorithms that solve the problem for arbitrary A with qualitatively similar guarantees run in exponential time. In the second setting, the design matrix A is unknown. Given input vectors y_1, y_2,...,y_p in R^d whose concatenation as columns forms Y in R^{d x p} , the goal is to decide whether Y=AX for matrices A in R^{d x m} and X in R^{m x p} such that each column of X is k-sparse, or whether Y is ""far"" from having such a decomposition. We give such a testing algorithm which projects the input vectors to O(log p/\eps^2) dimensions and assumes that the unknown A satisfies k-restricted isometry.

The post-starburst galaxies appear in both the optical green valley and the WISE Infrared Transition Zone (IRTZ). Furthermore, we find that post-starbursts occupy a distinct region [3.4]-[4.6] vs. [4.6]-[12] WISE colors, enabling the identification of this class of transitioning galaxies through the use of broad-band photometric criteria alone. We have investigated possible causes for the WISE colors of post-starbursts by constructing a composite spectral energy distribution (SED), finding that mid-infrared (4-12{\mu}m) properties of post-starbursts are consistent with either 11.3{\mu}m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, or Thermally Pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) and post-AGB stars. The composite SED of extended post- starburst galaxies with 22{\mu}m emission detected with signal to noise >3 requires a hot dust component to produce their observed rising mid-infrared SED between 12 and 22{\mu}m. The composite SED of WISE 22{\mu}m non-detections (S/N<3), created by stacking 22{\mu}m images, is also flat, requiring a hot dust component. The most likely source of this mid-infrared emission of these E+A galaxies is a buried active galactic nucleus. The inferred upper limit to the Eddington ratios of post-starbursts are 1e-2 to 1e-4, with an average of 1e-3. This suggests that AGNs are not radiatively dominant in these systems. This could mean that including selections able to identify active galactic nuclei as part of a search for transitioning and post-starburst galaxies would create a more complete census of the transition pathways taken as a galaxy quenches its star formation.

More efficient sampling schemes on the sphere improve reconstruction fidelity by restricting the solution-space and also by improving sparsity in wavelet space.

The implementation of an application for interactive spatio-temporal data exploration allows to hypothesize a high spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and to guide further quantitative work. The assumption of locally stationary flows is invalidated in a first approximation by empirical results, as shown by a strong spatial and temporal variability in shortest paths and in network topological measures such as betweenness centrality. Furthermore, the behavior of spatial autocorrelation index of congestion patterns at different spatial ranges suggest a chaotic evolution at the local scale, especially during peak hours.

We thereby predict that the spin relaxation rates of magnetic nanostructures of exchanged coupled local spins, such as as nanoengineered spin chains, have an oscillatory dependence on $k_F d$ , where $k_F$ is the Fermi wave length and $d$ is the inter-spin distance, very much like the celebrated oscillations in the RKKY interaction.
