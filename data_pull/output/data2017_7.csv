Reformulation of quantum entropy using probabilities for coarse-grained observation outcomes. <LINK> @FQXi'],https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09722,"We extend classical coarse-grained entropy, commonly used in many branches of physics, to the quantum realm. We find two coarse-grainings, one using measurements of local particle numbers and then total energy, and the second using local energy measurements, which lead to an entropy that is defined outside of equilibrium, is in accord with the thermodynamic entropy for equilibrium systems, and reaches the thermodynamic entropy in the long-time limit, even in genuinely isolated quantum systems. This answers the long-standing conceptual problem, as to which entropy is relevant for the formulation of the second thermodynamic law in closed quantum systems. This entropy could be in principle measured, especially now that experiments on such systems are becoming feasible. ",Quantum coarse-grained entropy and thermodynamics

Comments welcome!\n<LINK>'],https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07943,"In models of inflation driven by an axion-like pseudoscalar field, the inflaton, a, may couple to the standard model hypercharge via a Chern-Simons-type interaction, $L \subset a/(4\Lambda) F\tilde{F}$. This coupling results in explosive gauge field production during inflation, especially at its last stage, which has interesting phenomenological consequences: For one thing, the primordial hypermagnetic field is maximally helical. It is thus capable of sourcing the generation of nonzero baryon number, via the standard model chiral anomaly, around the time of electroweak symmetry breaking. For another thing, the gauge field production during inflation feeds back into the primordial tensor power spectrum, leaving an imprint in the stochastic background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we focus on the correlation between these two phenomena. Working in the approximation of instant reheating, we (1) update the investigation of baryogenesis via hypermagnetic fields from pseudoscalar inflation and (2) examine the corresponding implications for the GW spectrum. We find that successful baryogenesis requires a suppression scale Lambda of around Lambda ~ 3 x 10^17 GeV, which corresponds to a relatively weakly coupled axion. The gauge field production at the end of inflation is then typically accompanied by a peak in the GW spectrum at frequencies in the MHz range or above. The detection of such a peak is out of reach of present-day technology; but in the future, it may serve as a smoking-gun signal for baryogenesis from pseudoscalar inflation. Conversely, models that do yield an observable GW signal suffer from the overproduction of baryon number, unless the reheating temperature is lower than the electroweak scale.

Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is a state-of-the-art algorithm for learning policies when the expert's behavior is available as a fixed set of trajectories. We evaluate in terms of the expert's cost function and observe that the distribution of trajectory-costs is often more heavy-tailed for GAIL-agents than the expert at a number of benchmark continuous-control tasks. Thus, high-cost trajectories, corresponding to tail-end events of catastrophic failure, are more likely to be encountered by the GAIL-agents than the expert. This makes the reliability of GAIL-agents questionable when it comes to deployment in risk-sensitive applications like robotic surgery and autonomous driving. In this work, we aim to minimize the occurrence of tail-end events by minimizing tail risk within the GAIL framework. We quantify tail risk by the Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of trajectories and develop the Risk-Averse Imitation Learning (RAIL) algorithm. We observe that the policies learned with RAIL show lower tail-end risk than those of vanilla GAIL.

For some dark matter models, DMAF's ability to evacuate gas is enhanced in lower mass, concentrated halos where the injected energy is comparable to its gravitational binding energy. Therefore, we expect the strongest signs of dark matter annihilation to imprint themselves onto the baryonic structure of concentrated dwarf galaxies through their baryonic fraction and star formation history.

As it turns out, definitional interpreters, especially those written in monadic style, can provide a nice basis for a wide variety of collecting semantics, abstract interpretations, symbolic executions, and their intermixings. But the real insight of this story is a replaying of an insight from Reynold's landmark paper, Definitional Interpreters for Higher-Order Programming Languages, in which he observes definitional interpreters enable the defined-language to inherit properties of the defining-language. We show the same holds true for definitional abstract interpreters. Remarkably, we observe that abstract definitional interpreters can inherit the so-called ""pushdown control flow"" property, wherein function calls and returns are precisely matched in the abstract semantics, simply by virtue of the function call mechanism of the defining-language. The first approaches to achieve this property for higher-order languages appeared within the last ten years, and have since been the subject of many papers. These approaches start from a state-machine semantics and uniformly involve significant technical engineering to recover the precision of pushdown control flow. In contrast, starting from a definitional interpreter, the pushdown control flow property is inherent in the meta-language and requires no further technical mechanism to achieve.

We aim for our method to be able to distinguish between five models, which were chosen to lie along the $\sigma_8$ - $\Omega_m$ degeneracy, and have nearly the same two-point statistics. We design and implement a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) which learns the relation between five cosmological models and the mass maps they generate. We develop a new training strategy which ensures the good performance of the network for high levels of noise. We compare the performance of this approach to commonly used non-Gaussian statistics, namely the skewness and kurtosis of the convergence maps. We find that our implementation of DCNN outperforms the skewness and kurtosis statistics, especially for high noise levels. The network maintains the mean discrimination efficiency greater than $85\%$ even for noise levels corresponding to ground based lensing observations, while the other statistics perform worse in this setting, achieving efficiency less than $70\%$. This demonstrates the ability of CNN-based methods to efficiently break the $\sigma_8$ - $\Omega_m$ degeneracy with weak lensing mass maps alone.

A simple remedy is to treat Lasso as a model-selection procedure and to perform a second refitting step on the selected support. In this work we formalize the notion of refitting and provide oracle bounds for arbitrary refitting procedures of the Lasso solution. One of the most widely used refitting techniques which is based on Least-Squares may bring a problem of interpretability, since the signs of the refitted estimator might be flipped with respect to the original estimator. This problem arises from the fact that the Least-Squares refitting considers only the support of the Lasso solution, avoiding any information about signs or amplitudes. To this end we define a sign consistent refitting as an arbitrary refitting procedure, preserving the signs of the first step Lasso solution and provide Oracle inequalities for such estimators. Finally, we consider special refitting strategies: Bregman Lasso and Boosted Lasso. Bregman Lasso has a fruitful property to converge to the Sign-Least-Squares refitting (Least-Squares with sign constraints), which provides with greater interpretability. We additionally study the Bregman Lasso refitting in the case of orthogonal design, providing with simple intuition behind the proposed method. Boosted Lasso, in contrast, considers information about magnitudes of the first Lasso step and allows to develop better oracle rates for prediction. Finally, we conduct an extensive numerical study to show advantages of one approach over others in different synthetic and semi-real scenarios. ",On Lasso refitting strategies

We fill this gap by studying a dynamical threshold model over synthetic and real weighted networks with numerical and analytical tools. We show that the time of cascade emergence depends non-monotonously on weight heterogeneities, which accelerate or decelerate the dynamics, and lead to non-trivial parameter spaces for various networks and weight distributions. Our methodology applies to arbitrary binary state processes and link properties, and may prove instrumental in understanding the role of edge heterogeneities in various natural and social phenomena.

A ""ventral stream"" recognizes object class while a ""dorsal stream"" simultaneously interprets the geometric relationships necessary to execute successful grasps. We leverage the autonomous data collection capabilities of robots to obtain a large self-supervised dataset for training the dorsal stream, and use semi-supervised label propagation to train the ventral stream with only a modest amount of human supervision. We experimentally show that our approach improves upon grasping systems whose components are not learned end-to-end, including a baseline method that uses bounding box detection. Furthermore, we show that jointly training our model with auxiliary data consisting of non-semantic grasping data, as well as semantically labeled images without grasp actions, has the potential to substantially improve semantic grasping performance.

Bandeira,['New paper on the Sample Complexity of Multi-reference Alignment: <LINK>'],https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00943,"The growing role of data-driven approaches to scientific discovery has unveiled a large class of models that involve latent transformations with a rigid algebraic constraint. Three-dimensional molecule reconstruction in Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) is a central problem in this class. Despite decades of algorithmic and software development, there is still little theoretical understanding of the sample complexity of this problem, that is, number of images required for 3-D reconstruction. Here we consider multi-reference alignment (MRA), a simple model that captures fundamental aspects of the statistical and algorithmic challenges arising in cryo-EM and related problems. In MRA, an unknown signal is subject to two types of corruption: a latent cyclic shift and the more traditional additive white noise. The goal is to recover the signal at a certain precision from independent samples. While at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the number of observations needed to recover a generic signal is proportional to $1/\mathrm{SNR}$, we prove that it rises to a surprising $1/\mathrm{SNR}^3$ in the low SNR regime. This precise phenomenon was observed empirically more than twenty years ago for cryo-EM but has remained unexplained to date. Furthermore, our techniques can easily be extended to the heterogeneous MRA model where the samples come from a mixture of signals, as is often the case in applications such as cryo-EM, where molecules may have different conformations. This provides a first step towards a statistical theory for heterogeneous cryo-EM. ",The sample complexity of multi-reference alignment

However, despite decades of research, algorithms for achieving consistency in replicated systems are still poorly understood. Indeed, many published algorithms have later been shown to be incorrect, even some that were accompanied by supposed mechanised proofs of correctness. In this work, we focus on the correctness of Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), a class of algorithm that provides strong eventual consistency guarantees for replicated data. We develop a modular and reusable framework in the Isabelle/HOL interactive proof assistant for verifying the correctness of CRDT algorithms. We avoid correctness issues that have dogged previous mechanised proofs in this area by including a network model in our formalisation, and proving that our theorems hold in all possible network behaviours. Our axiomatic network model is a standard abstraction that accurately reflects the behaviour of real-world computer networks. Moreover, we identify an abstract convergence theorem, a property of order relations, which provides a formal definition of strong eventual consistency. We then obtain the first machine-checked correctness theorems for three concrete CRDTs: the Replicated Growable Array, the Observed-Remove Set, and an Increment-Decrement Counter. We find that our framework is highly reusable, developing proofs of correctness for the latter two CRDTs in a few hours and with relatively little CRDT-specific code.

An important objective for platforms implementing such measures might be to ensure that they are not unduly biased towards or against particular norms of offence. This paper provides some exploratory methods by which the normative biases of algorithmic content moderation systems can be measured, by way of a case study using an existing dataset of comments labelled for offence. We train classifiers on comments labelled by different demographic subsets (men and women) to understand how differences in conceptions of offence between these groups might affect the performance of the resulting models on various test sets.

Here we show that the inner Solar System's water is a simple byproduct of the giant planets' formation. Giant planet cores accrete gas slowly until the conditions are met for a rapid phase of runaway growth. As a gas giant's mass rapidly increases, the orbits of nearby planetesimals are destabilized and gravitationally scattered in all directions. Under the action of aerodynamic gas drag, a fraction of scattered planetesimals are deposited onto stable orbits interior to Jupiter's. This process is effective in populating the outer main belt with C-type asteroids that originated from a broad (5-20 AU-wide) region of the disk. As the disk starts to dissipate, scattered planetesimals reach sufficiently eccentric orbits to cross the terrestrial planet region and deliver water to the growing Earth. This mechanism does not depend strongly on the giant planets' orbital migration history and is generic: whenever a giant planet forms it invariably pollutes its inner planetary system with water-rich bodies.

We also use upwind discontinuous Galerkin schemes for the transport of layer depth. These transport schemes are incorporated into a semi-implicit formulation that is facilitated by a hybridisation method for solving the resulting mixed Helmholtz equation.

We show for the first time that these ellipticity gradients steepen dramatically as a function of galaxy mass, but we detect no mass-dependence in outer color gradients.
