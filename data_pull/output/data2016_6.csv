By combining our extensive radio observations of the Fermi-LAT GRB 160509A at $z = 1.17$ up to $20$ days after the burst with Swift X-ray observations and ground-based optical and near-infrared data, we show that the afterglow emission comprises distinct reverse shock and forward shock contributions: the reverse shock emission dominates in the radio band at $\lesssim10~$days, while the forward shock emission dominates in the X-ray, optical, and near-infrared bands. Through multi-wavelength modeling, we determine a circumburst density of $n_0\approx10^{-3}~$cm$^{-3}$, supporting our previous suggestion that a low-density circumburst environment is conducive to the production of long-lasting reverse shock radiation in the radio band. We infer the presence of a large excess X-ray absorption column, $N_{\rm H} \approx 1.5\times10^{22}~$cm$^{-2}$, and a high rest-frame optical extinction, $A_{\rm V}\approx3.4~$mag. We identify a jet break in the X-ray light curve at $t_{\rm jet}\approx6~$d, and thus derive a jet opening angle of $\theta_{\rm jet}\approx4~$deg, yielding a beaming-corrected kinetic energy and radiated $\gamma$-ray energy of $E_{\rm K}\approx4\times10^{50}~$erg and $E_{\gamma}\approx1.3\times10^{51}~$erg ($1$-$10^4~$keV, rest frame), respectively. Consistency arguments connecting the forward and reverse shocks suggest a deceleration time of $t_{\rm dec} \approx 460~$s$~\approx T_{90}$, a Lorentz factor of $\Gamma(t_{\rm dec})\approx330$, and a reverse shock to forward shock fractional magnetic energy density ratio of $R_{\rm B}\equiv\epsilon_{\rm B,RS}/\epsilon_{\rm B,FS}\approx8$.

However, their interpretability is critically limited due to the enormous complexity. In this study, we present a method to make a complex tree ensemble interpretable by simplifying the model. Specifically, we formalize the simplification of tree ensembles as a model selection problem. Given a complex tree ensemble, we aim at obtaining the simplest representation that is essentially equivalent to the original one. To this end, we derive a Bayesian model selection algorithm that optimizes the simplified model while maintaining the prediction performance.

As trade volumes increase and regulations become more stringent, manual inspection by trained operators is less and less viable due to low throughput. Machine vision techniques can assist operators in their task by automating parts of the inspection workflow. Since cars are routinely involved in trafficking, export fraud, and tax evasion schemes, they represent an attractive target for automated detection and flagging for subsequent inspection by operators. In this contribution, we describe a method for the detection of cars in X-ray cargo images based on trained-from-scratch Convolutional Neural Networks. By introducing an oversampling scheme that suitably addresses the low number of car images available for training, we achieved 100% car image classification rate for a false positive rate of 1-in-454. Cars that were partially or completely obscured by other goods, a modus operandi frequently adopted by criminals, were correctly detected. We believe that this level of performance suggests that the method is suitable for deployment in the field. It is expected that the generic object detection workflow described can be extended to other object classes given the availability of suitable training data.

This suggests a physical scale where quenching transitions from a slow ""starvation"" mode to a rapid ""stripping"" mode at low masses. We investigate the plausibility of this scenario using observed HI surface density profiles for a sample of 66 nearby galaxies as inputs to analytic calculations of ram-pressure and viscous stripping. Across a broad range of host properties, we find that stripping becomes increasingly effective at $M_{*} < 10^{8-9}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$, reproducing the critical mass scale observed. However, for canonical values of the circumgalactic medium density ($n_{\rm halo} < 10^{-3.5}$ ${\rm cm}^{-3}$), we find that stripping is not fully effective; infalling satellites are, on average, stripped of < 40 - 70% of their cold gas reservoir, which is insufficient to match observations. By including a host halo gas distribution that is clumpy and therefore contains regions of higher density, we are able to reproduce the observed HI gas fractions (and thus the high quenched fraction and short quenching timescale) of Local Group satellites, suggesting that a host halo with clumpy gas may be crucial for quenching low-mass systems in Local Group-like (and more massive) host halos.

A few counties in the Texas Panhandle and central Kansas have annual rates that exceed four tornadoes per 10,000 square km. Refitting the model after removing the least damaging tornadoes from the data (EF0) produces a similar map but with the greatest tornado risk shifted south and eastward. Second, a space-time model is fit to the counts aggregated in raster cells with terms that control for changes in climate factors. Results provide a short-term view of risk. The short-term view identifies the shift of tornado activity away from the Ohio Valley under El Ni\~no conditions and away from the Southeast under positive North Atlantic oscillation conditions. The combined predictor effects on the local rates is quantified by fitting the model after leaving out the year to be predicted from the data.

Our cloudiness index is based on measuring the transit radii associated with the line center and wing of the sodium or potassium line. In deriving this index, we revisited the algebraic formulae for inferring the isothermal pressure scale height from transit measurements. We demonstrate that the formulae of Lecavelier et al. and Benneke & Seager are identical: the former is inferring the temperature while assuming a value for the mean molecular mass and the latter is inferring the mean molecular mass while assuming a value for the temperature. More importantly, these formulae cannot be used to distinguish between cloudy and cloudfree atmospheres. We derive values of our cloudiness index for a small sample of 7 hot Saturns/Jupiters taken from Sing et al. We show that WASP-17b, WASP-31b and HAT-P-1b are nearly cloudfree at visible wavelengths. We find the tentative trend that more irradiated atmospheres tend to have less clouds consisting of sub-micron-sized particles. We also derive absolute sodium and/or potassium abundances $\sim 10^2$ cm$^{-3}$ for WASP-17b, WASP-31b and HAT-P-1b (and upper limits for the other objects).

We demonstrate, using a competitive simplified dark matter model, the power of this approach. The Contur method is highly scaleable to other models and future measurements.

In this paper we introduce a fuzzy term weighing approach that makes the most of the HTML structure for document clustering. We set forth and build on the hypothesis that a good representation can take advantage of how humans skim through documents to extract the most representative words. The authors of web pages make use of HTML tags to convey the most important message of a web page through page elements that attract the readers' attention, such as page titles or emphasized elements. We define a set of criteria to exploit the information provided by these page elements, and introduce a fuzzy combination of these criteria that we evaluate within the context of a web page clustering task.

Nevertheless, there is no general constructive method for finding such martingales that yields diffusions. We consider the uniform peacock, namely the peacock with uniform law at all times on a generic time-varying support [a(t); b(t)]. We derive explicitly the corresponding SDEs and prove that, under certain ""conic"" conditions on a(t) and b(t), they admit a unique strong diffusive solution. To guess the candidate SDE we resort to the approach of inverting the Fokker Planck equation. Dupire (1994) did this for volatility modeling. Here we tackle the inversion with the caveats needed when dealing with uniform margins with conic boundaries. This was done originally in the unpublished preprint by Brigo (1999). Independently, Madan and Yor (2002) obtained the result as a simple application of Dupire. Once the SDE is guessed, we analyze it rigorously, discussing the cases where our approach adds strong uniqueness of the solution of the SDE and cases where only a weak solution is obtained. We further study the local time and activity of the solution. We then study the peacock with uniform law at all times on a constant support [-1; 1] and derive the SDE of an associated mean-reverting diffusion process with uniform margins that is not a martingale. For the related SDE we prove existence of a solution. We derive the exact transition densities for both the mean reverting and the original conic martingale cases. We prove limit-laws and ergodic results: the SDE solution transition law tends to be uniform after a long time. Finally, we provide a numerical study confirming the desired uniform behaviour. These results may be used to model random probabilities, recovery rates or correlations. ","SDEs with uniform distributions: Peacocks, Conic martingales and ergodic

We propose that the transformation of NSCs into SMBHs occurs via runaway tidal captures, once NSCs exceed a certain critical central density and velocity dispersion. The bottleneck in this process, as with all collisional runaways, is growing the first e-fold in black hole mass. The growth of a stellar mass black hole past this bottleneck occurs as tidally captured stars are consumed in repeated episodes of mass transfer at pericenter. Tidal captures may turn off as a growth channel once the black hole reaches a mass ~100-1000 solar masses, but tidal disruption events will continue and appear capable of growing the seed SMBH to larger sizes. The runaway slows (becomes sub-exponential) once the seed SMBH consumes the core of its host NSC. While the bulk of the cosmic mass density in SMBHs is ultimately produced (via the Soltan-Paczynski argument) by episodic gaseous accretion in very massive galaxies, the smallest SMBHs have probably grown from strong tidal encounters with NSC stars. SMBH seeds that grow for a time $t$ entirely through this channel will follow simple power law relations with the velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, of their host galaxy. In the simplest regime it is $M_\bullet \sim \sigma^{3/2}\sqrt{M_\star t / G} \sim 10^{6}M_\odot (\sigma / 50~{\rm km~s}^{-1})^{3/2}(t/10^{10}~{\rm yr})^{1/2}$, but the exponents and prefactor can differ slightly depending on the details of loss cone refilling.

This is the first BAL quasar that has signatures of recently truncated star formation, which we estimate ended about 40 Myr ago. The characteristic signatures of an FeLoBAL require high column densities, which could be explained by the emergence of a young quasar from an early, dust-enshrouded phase, or by clouds compressed by a blast wave. The age of the starburst component is comparable to estimates of the lifetime of quasars, so if we assume the quasar activity is related to the truncation of the star formation, this object is better explained by the blast wave scenario.

A ridge function is constant along several directions in its domain, so fitting occurs on the coordinates of a low-dimensional subspace of the input space. We review essential theory for ridge approximation---e.g., the best mean-squared approximation and an optimal low-dimensional subspace---and we prove that the gradient-based active subspace is near-stationary for the least-squares problem that defines an optimal subspace. Motivated by the theory, we propose a computational heuristic that uses an estimated active subspace as an initial guess for a ridge approximation fitting problem. We show a simple example where the heuristic fails, which reveals a type of function for which the proposed approach is inappropriate. We then propose a simple alternating heuristic for fitting a ridge function, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the active subspace initial guess applied to an airfoil model of drag as a function of its 18 shape parameters.
