First, we gathered a unique and diverse multi-ethnic dataset of OCT scans consisting of glaucoma and non-glaucomatous cases obtained from four tertiary care eye hospitals located in four different countries. Using this longitudinal data, we achieved state-of-the-art results for automatically detecting Glaucoma from a single raw OCT using a 3D Deep Learning system. These results are close to human doctors in a variety of settings across heterogeneous datasets and scanning environments. To verify correctness and interpretability of the automated categorization, we used saliency maps to find areas of focus for the model. Matching human doctor behavior, the model predictions indeed correlated with the conventional diagnostic parameters in the OCT printouts, such as the retinal nerve fiber layer. We further used our model to find new areas in the 3D data that are presently not being identified as a diagnostic parameter to detect glaucoma by human doctors. Namely, we found that the Lamina Cribrosa (LC) region can be a valuable source of helpful diagnostic information previously unavailable to doctors during routine clinical care because it lacks a quantitative printout. Our model provides such volumetric quantification of this region. We found that even when a majority of the RNFL is removed, the LC region can distinguish glaucoma. This is clinically relevant in high myopes, when the RNFL is already reduced, and thus the LC region may help differentiate glaucoma in this confounding situation. We further generalize this approach to create a new algorithm called DiagFind that provides a recipe for finding new diagnostic information in medical imagery that may have been previously unusable by doctors.

During diagnosis, gait abnormalities are among the important symptoms that physicians should consider. However, gait evaluation is challenging and relies on the expertise and subjectivity of clinicians. In this context, the use of an intelligent gait analysis algorithm may assist physicians in order to facilitate the diagnosis process. This paper proposes a novel intelligent Parkinson detection system based on deep learning techniques to analyze gait information. We used 1D convolutional neural network (1D-Convnet) to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier. The proposed model processes 18 1D-signals coming from foot sensors measuring the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF). The first part of the network consists of 18 parallel 1D-Convnet corresponding to system inputs. The second part is a fully connected network that connects the concatenated outputs of the 1D-Convnets to obtain a final classification. We tested our algorithm in Parkinson's detection and in the prediction of the severity of the disease with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Our experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method in the detection of Parkinson disease based on gait data. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 98.7 %. To our knowledge, this is the state-of-the-start performance in Parkinson's gait recognition. Furthermore, we achieved an accuracy of 85.3 % in Parkinson's severity prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to perform a severity prediction based on the UPDRS. Our results show that the model is able to learn intrinsic characteristics from gait data and to generalize to unseen subjects, which could be helpful in a clinical diagnosis.

They can be calculated in thermal equilibrium using lattice simulations, and be connected to moments of event-by-event net-particle multiplicity distributions. We calculate them from continuum extrapolated lattice simulations at $\mu_B=0$, and present a finite-$\mu_B$ extrapolation, comparing two different methods. In order to relate the grand canonical observables to the experimentally available net-particle fluctuations and correlations, we perform a Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model analysis, which allows us to completely break down the contributions from different hadrons. We then construct suitable hadronic proxies for fluctuations ratios, and study their behavior at finite chemical potentials. We also study the effect of introducing acceptance cuts, and argue that the small dependence of certain ratios on the latter allows for a direct comparison with lattice QCD results, provided that the same cuts are applied to all hadronic species. Finally, we perform a comparison for the constructed quantities for experimentally available measurements from the STAR Collaboration. Thus, we estimate the chemical freeze-out temperature to 165 MeV using a strangeness-related proxy. This is a rather high temperature for the use of the Hadron Resonance Gas, thus, further lattice studies are necessary to provide first principle results at intermediate $\mu_B$.

Previous works show that the richer family of prior distributions may help to avoid the mode collapse problem in GANs and to improve the evidence lower bound in VAEs. We propose a new family of prior distributions---Tensor Ring Induced Prior (TRIP)---that packs an exponential number of Gaussians into a high-dimensional lattice with a relatively small number of parameters. We show that these priors improve Fr\'echet Inception Distance for GANs and Evidence Lower Bound for VAEs.

By exploiting the multilevel structure of the discretised parameters and discretised forward models, we design a Rayleigh-Ritz procedure to significantly reduce the computational effort in building the LIS and operating with DILI proposals. Second, the resulting DILI-MCMC can drastically improve the sampling efficiency of MCMC at each level, and hence reduce the integration error of the multilevel algorithm for fixed CPU time. To be able to fully exploit the power of multilevel MCMC and to reduce the dependencies of samples on different levels for a parallel implementation, we also suggest a new pooling strategy for allocating computational resources across different levels and constructing Markov chains at higher levels conditioned on those simulated on lower levels.

We report here the detection of a new outburst from this source, which occurred during two more recent XMM-Newton observations performed on 17 to 20 December 2016 lasting for 310 ks. The luminosity was similar as in December 2000, and the 0.2-2.0 keV light curve revealed again a periodic modulation, with a period of 4.68+-0.26h, significant only in the first of the two observations. Taking into account the large uncertainties (the 2001 period was re-estimated at 5.7+-1.1h), the two values could be marginally compatible, and maybe associated with an orbital period, although the signal strength is highly variable. Thanks to the new long exposures, an additional absorption feature is now visible in the spectra, that we modelled with an absorption edge.

Moreover, simple (static) image segmentation models, alone, can perform competitively against these methods, which further suggests that the way temporal dependencies are modelled should be reconsidered. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we explore simple yet effective strategies to model long-term temporal dependencies. Inspired by the non-local operators of [70], we introduce a technique to establish dense correspondences between pixel embeddings of a reference ""anchor"" frame and the current one. This allows the learning of pairwise dependencies at arbitrarily long distances without conditioning on intermediate frames.

We modeled both wind absorption and extended wind re-emission components using PION, a self-consistent photoionized absorption model. In all but one case, two photoionization zones were required in order to obtain acceptable fits. Two independent constraints on launching radii, obtained via the ionization parameter formalism and the dynamical broadening of the re-emission, helped characterize the geometry of the wind. The innermost wind components ($r \simeq {10}^{2-3}$ $GM/{c}^{2}$) tend towards small volume filling factors, high ionization, densities up to $n \simeq {10}^{15-16} {\text{cm}}^{-3}$, and outflow velocities of $\sim 0.003c$. These small launching radii and large densities require magnetic driving, as they are inconsistent with numerical and analytical treatments of thermally driven winds. Outer wind components ($r \simeq {10}^{5}$ $GM/{c}^{2}$) are significantly less ionized and have filling factors near unity. Their larger launching radii, lower densities ($n \simeq {10}^{12} {\text{cm}}^{-3}$), and outflow velocities ($\sim 0.0007c$) are nominally consistent with thermally driven winds. The overall wind structure suggests that these components may also be part of a broader MHD outflow and perhaps better described as magneto-thermal hybrid winds.

In this paper, we simulate EHT observations for a gas cloud intermittently falling onto a black hole, and construct a method for spin measurement based on its relativistic flux variation. The light curve of the infalling gas cloud is composed of peaks formed by photons which directly reach a distant observer and by secondary ones reaching the observer after more than one rotation around the black hole. The time interval between the peaks is determined by a period of photon rotation near the photon circular orbit which uniquely depends on the spin. We perform synthetic EHT observations for SgrA* under a more realistic situation that a number of gas clouds intermittently fall towards the black hole with various initial parameters. Even for this case, the black hole spin dependence is detectable in correlated flux densities which are accurately calibrated by baselines between sites with redundant stations.

More than a dozen such planets, like Proxima Centauri b and TRAPPIST-1 e, are in close-in configurations and their proximity to the host star makes them highly sensitive to stellar activity. Episodic events such as flares have the potential to cause severe damage to close-in planets, adversely impacting their habitability. Flares on fast rotating young M stars occur up to 100 times more frequently than on G-type stars which makes their planets even more susceptible to stellar activity. Stellar Energetic Particles (SEPs) emanating from Stellar Proton Events (SPEs) cause atmospheric damage (erosion and photochemical changes), and produce secondary particles, which in turn results in enhanced radiation dosage on planetary surfaces. We explore the role of SPEs and planetary factors in determining planetary surface radiation doses. These factors include SPE fluence and spectra, and planetary column density and magnetic field strength. Taking particle spectra from 70 major solar events (observed between 1956 and 2012) as proxy, we use the GEANT4 Monte Carlo model to simulate SPE interactions with exoplanetary atmospheres, and we compute surface radiation dose. We demonstrate that in addition to fluence, SPE spectrum is also a crucial factor in determining the surface radiation dose.

For decentralized settings, it is still unclear how to efficiently combine local updates and decentralized communication. In this work, we propose an algorithm named as LD-SGD, which incorporates arbitrary update schemes that alternate between multiple Local updates and multiple Decentralized SGDs, and provide an analytical framework for LD-SGD. Under the framework, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence. We show that LD-SGD converges to a critical point for a wide range of update schemes when the objective is non-convex and the training data are non-identically independent distributed. Moreover, our framework brings many insights into the design of update schemes for decentralized optimization. As examples, we specify two update schemes and show how they help improve communication efficiency. Specifically, the first scheme alternates the number of local and global update steps.

The second scheme is to periodically shrink the length of local updates. We show that the decaying strategy helps improve communication efficiency both theoretically and empirically.

Our analysis reveals that the all-layer margin has a clear and direct relationship with generalization for deep models. This enables the following concrete applications of the all-layer margin: 1) by analyzing the all-layer margin, we obtain tighter generalization bounds for neural nets which depend on Jacobian and hidden layer norms and remove the exponential dependency on depth 2) our neural net results easily translate to the adversarially robust setting, giving the first direct analysis of robust test error for deep networks, and 3) we present a theoretically inspired training algorithm for increasing the all-layer margin.

The resulting model can accurately predict future loads (short-term) of individual consumers, even if these were not included in the original training set. This entails a great potential for large scale applications as once the single network is trained, accurate individual forecast for new consumers can be obtained at almost no computational cost.

Currently, one way to achieve those predictions is by running cosmological numerical simulations.

Dynamical analyses have generally assumed that this galaxy is pressure supported, with the relatively small velocity dispersion of the globular cluster population indicating the deficit of dark matter. However, the presence of a significant rotation of the globular cluster population could substantially modify this conclusion. Here we present the discovery of such a signature of rotation in the kinematics of NGC 1052-DF2's globular clusters, with a velocity amplitude of $\sim12.44^{+4.40}_{-5.16}$ km/s, which, through Bayesian model comparison, represents a marginally better fit to the available kinematic data; note that this rotation is distinct from, and approximately perpendicular to, the recently identified rotation of the stellar component of NGC 1052-DF2. Assuming this truly represents an underlying rotation, it is shown that the determined mass depends upon the inclination of the rotational component and, with a moderate inclination, the resultant mass to light ratio can exceed $M/L\sim10$.

This has spurred work on preprocessing algorithms for embedding the graph representing problem variables with quadratic terms into the hardware graph representing qubits adjacencies, such as the Chimera graph in hardware produced by D-Wave Systems. In this paper, we use integer linear programming to search for an embedding of the problem graph into certain classes of minors of the Chimera graph, which we call template embeddings. One of these classes corresponds to complete bipartite graphs, for which we show the limitation of the existing approach based on minimum Odd Cycle Transversals (OCTs). One of the formulations presented is exact, and thus can be used to certify the absence of a minor embedding using that template. On an extensive test set consisting of random graphs from five different classes of varying size and sparsity, we can embed more graphs than a state-of-the-art OCT-based approach, our approach scales better with the hardware size, and the runtime is generally orders of magnitude smaller.

We show that conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) can be harnessed to predict how changing the underlying physics alters the simulation results. To illustrate this, we train a cGAN to learn the impact of dark matter annihilation feedback (DMAF) on the gas density distribution. The predicted gas density slices are visually difficult to distinguish from their real brethren and the peak counts differ by less than 10 per cent for all test samples (the average deviation is < 3 per cent). Finally, we invert the problem and show that cGANs are capable of endowing smooth density distributions with realistic substructure. The cGAN does however have difficulty generating new knots as well as creating/eliminating bubble-like structures. We conclude that trained cGANs can be an effective approach to provide mock samples of cosmological simulations incorporating DMAF physics from existing samples of standard cosmological simulations of the evolution of cosmic structure.

One particular way of tackling this is grounded in an algorithmic description of life: living organisms can be seen as systems that extract and process information from their surroundings in order to reduce uncertainty. Here we take this computational approach using a simple bit string model of coevolving agents and their parasites. While agents try to predict their worlds, parasites do the same with their hosts. The result of this process is that, in order to escape their parasites, the host agents expand their computational complexity despite the cost of maintaining it. This, in turn, is followed by increasingly complex parasitic counterparts. Such arms races display several qualitative phases, from monotonous to punctuated evolution or even ecological collapse. Our minimal model illustrates the relevance of parasites in providing an active mechanism for expanding living complexity beyond simple replicators, suggesting that parasitic agents are likely to be a major evolutionary driver for biological complexity.

This assumption has important policy implications, although rigorous empirical tests have been so far hindered by the lack of suitable data. Here, we advance the debate by looking into the temporal evolution of the scaling laws for 5507 municipalities in Brazil. We focus on the relationship between population size and two urban variables, GDP and water network length, analyzing the time evolution of the system of cities as well as their individual trajectory. We find that longitudinal (individual) scaling exponents are city-specific, but they are distributed around an average value that approaches to the transversal scaling exponent when the data are decomposed to eliminate external factors, and when we only consider cities with a sufficiently large growth rate. Such results give support to the idea that the longitudinal dynamics is a micro-scaling version of the transversal dynamics of the entire urban system. Finally, we propose a mathematical framework that connects the microscopic level to global behavior, and, in all analyzed cases, we find good agreement between theoretical prediction and empirical evidence.

To maximize the efficiency of follow-up observations, a prioritization scheme must be developed to determine which planets are most likely to be EECs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian method for estimating the likelihood that any directly imaged extrasolar planet is a true exo-Earth candidate by interpreting the planet's apparent magnitude and separation in light of existing exoplanet statistics. As a specific application of this general framework, we use published estimates of the discovery yield of future space-based direct imaging mission concepts to conduct ""mock surveys"" in which we compute the likelihood that each detected planet is an EEC. We find that it will be difficult to determine which planets are EECs with $>50\%$ confidence using single-band photometry immediately upon their detection. The best way to reduce this ambiguity would be to constrain the planet's orbit by revisiting the system multiple times or through a radial velocity precursor survey. Astrometric or radial velocity constraints on the planet's mass would offer a lesser benefit. Finally, we show that a Bayesian approach to prioritizing targets would improve the follow-up efficiency of a direct imaging survey versus a blind approach using the same data. For example, the prioritized approach could reduce the amount of integration time required for the spectral detection (or rejection) of water absorption in most EECs by a factor of two.

While for phases characterized by a broken symmetry, the use of unsupervised methods has proven to be successful, topological phases without a local order parameter seem to be much harder to identify without supervision. Here, we use an unsupervised approach to identify topological phases and transitions out of them. We train artificial neural nets to relate configurational data or measurement outcomes to quantities like temperature or tuning parameters in the Hamiltonian. The accuracy of these predictive models can then serve as an indicator for phase transitions. We successfully illustrate this approach on both the classical Ising gauge theory as well as on the quantum ground state of a generalized toric code.

Under the framework, we present a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence. We show that LD-SGD converges to a critical point for a wide range of update schemes when the objective is non-convex and the training data are non-identically independent distributed. Moreover, our framework brings many insights into the design of update schemes for decentralized optimization. As examples, we specify two update schemes and show how they help improve communication efficiency. Specifically, the first scheme alternates the number of local and global update steps. From our analysis, the ratio of the number of local updates to that of decentralized SGD trades off communication and computation. The second scheme is to periodically shrink the length of local updates. We show that the decaying strategy helps improve communication efficiency both theoretically and empirically.

FMs' assessments not only refer to the quality of biomedical papers, but also to their characteristics (by assigning certain tags to the papers): for example, are the presented findings or formulated hypotheses novel (tags ""new findings"" and ""hypothesis"")? We used these and other tags to investigate the convergent validity of both novelty scores. Our study reveals different results for the novelty scores: the results for novelty score U are mostly in agreement with previously formulated expectations. We found, for instance, that for a standard deviation (one unit) increase in novelty score U, the expected number of assignments of the ""new finding"" tag increase by 7.47%. The results for novelty score W, however, do not reflect convergent validity with the FMs' assessments: only the results for some tags are in agreement with the expectations.

However, training such models requires expensive annotation of complex structures, which hinders their adoption. Learning to actively-learn (LTAL) is a recent paradigm for reducing the amount of labeled data by learning a policy that selects which samples should be labeled. In this work, we examine LTAL for learning semantic representations, such as QA-SRL. We show that even an oracle policy that is allowed to pick examples that maximize performance on the test set (and constitutes an upper bound on the potential of LTAL), does not substantially improve performance compared to a random policy. We investigate factors that could explain this finding and show that a distinguishing characteristic of successful applications of LTAL is the interaction between optimization and the oracle policy selection process. In successful applications of LTAL, the examples selected by the oracle policy do not substantially depend on the optimization procedure, while in our setup the stochastic nature of optimization strongly affects the examples selected by the oracle. We conclude that the current applicability of LTAL for improving data efficiency in learning semantic meaning representations is limited.

We conjecture that popularity bias is one important factor leading to miscalibration in recommendation.
