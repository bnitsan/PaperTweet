Our visualization provides a unique way to navigate time series that involves a ""vocabulary of patterns"" developed by using a dimensionality reduction technique,Symbolic Aggregate approXimation(SAX).

The celebrated balance heuristic estimator belongs to this class of methods and has proved very successful in computer graphics. The basic ingredients for computing the estimator are: a set of proposal distributions, indexed by some discrete label, and a predetermined number of draws from each of these proposals. However, if the number of available proposals is much larger than the number of permitted importance points, one needs to select, possibly at random, which of these distributions will be used. The focus of this work lies within the previous context, exploring some improvements and variations of the balance heuristic via a novel extended-space representation of the estimator, leading to straightforward annealing schemes for variance reduction purposes. In addition, we also look at the intractable scenario where the proposal density is only available as a joint function with the discrete label, as may be encountered in problems where an ordering is imposed. For this case, we look at combinations of correlated unbiased estimators which also fit into the extended-space representation and, in turn, will provide other interesting solutions.

A recent advance of end-to-end TTS is due to a key technique called attention mechanisms, and all successful methods proposed so far have been based on soft attention mechanisms. However, although network structures are becoming increasingly complex, end-to-end TTS systems with soft attention mechanisms may still fail to learn and to predict accurate alignment between the input and output. This may be because the soft attention mechanisms are too flexible. Therefore, we propose an approach that has more explicit but natural constraints suitable for speech signals to make alignment learning and prediction of end-to-end TTS systems more robust. The proposed system, with the constrained alignment scheme borrowed from segment-to-segment neural transduction (SSNT), directly calculates the joint probability of acoustic features and alignment given an input text. The alignment is designed to be hard and monotonically increase by considering the speech nature, and it is treated as a latent variable and marginalized during training. During prediction, both the alignment and acoustic features can be generated from the probabilistic distributions. The advantages of our approach are that we can simplify many modules for the soft attention and that we can train the end-to-end TTS model using a single likelihood function. As far as we know, our approach is the first end-to-end TTS without a soft attention mechanism. ","Initial investigation of an encoder-decoder end-to-end TTS framework

Galaxy morphologies were characterized using non-parametric statistics (Gini, $M_{20}$, Concentration and Asymmetry) derived from mock images computed using a 3D radiative transfer technique and post-processed to approximate observational surveys. The resulting morphologies were contrasted to observational results from a sample of $\log_{10}(M_{*}/M_\odot) > 10$ galaxies at $z \sim 0.05$ in the GAMA survey. We find that the morphologies of EAGLE galaxies reproduce observations, except for asymmetry values which are larger in the simulated galaxies. Additionally, we study the effect of spatial resolution in the computation of non-parametric morphologies, finding that Gini and Asymmetry values are systematically reduced with decreasing spatial resolution. Gini values for lower mass galaxies are especially affected. Comparing against other large scale simulations, the non-parametric statistics of EAGLE galaxies largely agree with those found in IllustrisTNG. Additionally, EAGLE galaxies mostly reproduce observed trends between morphology and star formation rate and galaxy size. Finally, We also find a significant correlation between optical and kinematic estimators of morphologies, although galaxy classification based on an optical or a kinematic criteria results in different galaxy subsets. The correlation between optical and kinematic morphologies is stronger in central galaxies than in satellites, indicating differences in morphological evolution.

One prominent approach for data collection has been to automatically generate pseudo-language paired with logical forms, and paraphrase the pseudo-language to natural language through crowdsourcing (Wang et al., 2015). However, this data collection procedure often leads to low performance on real data, due to a mismatch between the true distribution of examples and the distribution induced by the data collection procedure. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze two sources of mismatch in this process: the mismatch in logical form distribution and the mismatch in language distribution between the true and induced distributions. We quantify the effects of these mismatches, and propose a new data collection approach that mitigates them. Assuming access to unlabeled utterances from the true distribution, we combine crowdsourcing with a paraphrase model to detect correct logical forms for the unlabeled utterances. On two datasets, our method leads to 70.6 accuracy on average on the true distribution, compared to 51.3 in paraphrasing-based data collection. ","Don't paraphrase, detect!

This paper poses the question: given this recent progress, and limited human annotation, what is the most effective method for efficiently creating high-quality entity recognizers in under-resourced languages? Based on extensive experimentation using both simulated and real human annotation, we find a dual-strategy approach best, starting with a cross-lingual transferred model, then performing targeted annotation of only uncertain entity spans in the target language, minimizing annotator effort. Results demonstrate that cross-lingual transfer is a powerful tool when very little data can be annotated, but an entity-targeted annotation strategy can achieve competitive accuracy quickly, with just one-tenth of training data.

We make two key contributions towards improving A* tree search. First, we show that the consensus maximization tree structure used previously actually contains paths that connect nodes at both adjacent and non-adjacent levels. Crucially, paths connecting non-adjacent levels are redundant for tree search, but they were not avoided previously. We propose a new acceleration strategy that avoids such redundant paths. In the second contribution, we show that the existing branch pruning technique also deteriorates quickly with the problem dimension. We then propose a new branch pruning technique that is less dimension-sensitive to address this issue. Experiments show that both new techniques can significantly accelerate A* tree search, making it reasonably efficient on inputs that were previously out of reach.

In this work, we find that the CaST radial distribution is consistent with the radial distribution of two populations of stars: old (ages > 5 Gyr), low-metallicity (Z/Zsol < 0.3) stars and globular clusters. While no obvious progenitor scenario arises from considering old, metal-poor stars, the alternative production site of globular clusters leads us to narrow down the list of possible candidates to three binary scenarios: mergers of helium and oxygen/neon white dwarfs; tidal disruptions of helium white dwarfs by neutron stars; and stable accretion from low-mass helium-burning stars onto white dwarfs. While rare in the field, these binary systems can be formed dynamically at much higher rates in globular clusters. Subsequent binary hardening both increases their interaction rate and ejects them from their parent globular clusters prior to mass transfer contact. Their production in, and ejection from, globular clusters may explain their radial distribution and the absence of globular clusters at their explosion site. This model predicts a currently undiscovered high rate of CaSTs in nuclear star clusters. Alternatively, an undetermined progenitor scenario involving old, low-metallicity stars may instead hold the key to understanding CaSTs. ",The Progenitors of Calcium-Strong Transients

Therefore, three main gaps in previous works are addressed including, analyzing various subsets of top forecasters as inputs for meta-learners; evaluating the effect of forecasting error measures; and assessing the role of the dimensionality of the feature space on the forecasting errors of meta-learners. All of these objectives are achieved with the help of a diverse state-of-the-art pool of forecasters and meta-learners. For this purpose, first, a pool of forecasting algorithms is implemented on the NN5 competition dataset and ranked based on the two error measures. Then, six machine-learning classifiers known as meta-learners, are trained on the extracted features of the time series in order to assign the most suitable forecasting method for the various subsets of the pool of forecasters. Furthermore, two-dimensionality reduction methods are implemented in order to investigate the role of feature space dimension on the performance of meta-learners. In general, it was found that meta-learners were able to defeat all of the individual benchmark forecasters; this performance was improved even after applying the feature selection method.

This occurs due to interference between multiple modes excited by the incident light. In contrast to metasurface-based gratings with multiple resonant sub-elements, a periodic arrangement of such non-resonant diffracting elements allows for broadband operation and a strong tolerance for variations in angle of incidence.

In particular, the data prefers a potential which flattens at large field displacements. An MCMC analysis of mock data shows that the next-generation CMB observations (i.e., CMB-S4) can unambiguously detect the presence of the EDE at very high significance. This projected sensitivity to the EDE dynamics is mainly driven by improved measurements of the $E$-mode polarization. We also explore new observational signatures of EDE scalar field dynamics: (i) We find that depending on the strength of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the presence of the EDE might imply the existence of isocurvature perturbations in the CMB. (ii) We show that a strikingly rapid, scale-dependent growth of EDE field perturbations can result from parametric resonance driven by the anharmonic oscillating field for $n\approx 2$.

The interpretation of this result in terms of dark matter models is presented in a companion paper. ","Double dark matter vision: twice the number of compact-source lenses

To this end we present a novel non-equilibrium master equation for the relative motion of quarkonium in a medium, starting from Lindblad operators derived systematically from quantum field theory. In order to implement the corresponding dynamics, we deploy the well established quantum state diffusion method. In turn we reveal how the full quantum evolution can be cast in the form of a stochastic non-linear Schr\""odinger equation. This for the first time provides a direct link from quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to phenomenological models based on non-linear Schr\""odinger equations. Proof of principle simulations in one-dimension show that dissipative effects indeed allow the relative motion of the constituent quarks in a quarkonium at rest to thermalize.

Recently, simultaneous field and particle observations have indeed revealed enhanced whistler-like fluctuations in the presence of counter-beaming populations of electrons, connecting these fluctuations to the whistler heat-flux instability (WHFI). This instability is predicted only for limited conditions of electron beam-plasmas, and was not captured in numerical simulations yet. In this letter we report the first simulations of WHFI in particle-in-cell (PIC) setups, realistic for the solar wind conditions, and without temperature gradients or anisotropies to trigger the instability in the initiation phase. The velocity distributions have a complex reaction to the enhanced whistler fluctuations conditioning the instability saturation by a decrease of the relative drifts combined with induced (effective) temperature anisotropies (heating the core electrons and pitch-angle and energy scattering the strahl). These results are in good agreement with a recent quasilinear approach, and support therefore a largely accepted belief that WHFI saturates at moderate amplitudes. In anti-sunward direction the strahl becomes skewed with a pitch-angle distribution decreasing in width as electron energy increases, that seems to be characteristic to self-generated whistlers and not to small-scale turbulence.

We predict that there is little difference between UDGs and non-UDGs in terms of their dark matter halo masses and spins, their $z = 0$ colors, nor their evolution over time. UDGs are typically larger dwarf galaxies well before in-fall into the cluster and have had their star formation quenched for longer, typically due to entering the cluster earlier.

Its main reservoirs in planet-forming disks have previously eluded detection: gaseous molecules only account for $<1\,$\% of total elemental sulfur, with the rest likely in either ices or refractory minerals. Mechanisms such as giant planets can filter out dust from gas accreting onto disk-hosting stars. For stars above 1.4 solar masses, this leaves a chemical signature on the stellar photosphere that can be used to determine the fraction of each element that is locked in dust. Here, we present an application of this method to sulfur, zinc, and sodium. We analyse the accretion-contaminated photospheres of a sample of young stars and find $(89\pm8)\,$\% of elemental sulfur is in refractory form in their disks. The main carrier is much more refractory than water ice, consistent with sulfide minerals such as FeS. ",Abundant refractory sulfur in protoplanetary disks

As a solution, we present a novel maximum likelihood estimation approach that exploits the friendship paradox to sample more efficiently from the tail of the degree distribution. We analytically show that the proposed method results in a smaller bias, variance and a Cramer-Rao lower bound compared to the vanilla maximum-likelihood estimate obtained with uniformly sampled nodes (which is the most commonly used method in literature). Detailed numerical and empirical results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed method under different conditions and how it compares with alternative methods.

Results from analyses on real platforms show that volunteers tend to explore multiple projects, but they perform tasks regularly in just a few of them; few projects attract much attention from volunteers; volunteers recruited from other projects on the platform tend to get more engaged than those recruited outside the platform.

Most companions will be cooler and less massive than their host star. Their lower mass leads to faster orbital velocities, and thus a potentially larger beaming effect. The lower temperature will mean that most of their light is emitted at longer wavelengths, where the relative photometric dominance of the primary is reduced. Thus for some systems, the secondary companion can be the main contributor to observed relativistic beaming signals at long wavelengths. Furthermore, if the system is observed over a range of wavelengths we can independently constrain the temperature of the companion, and the mass and radius ratio of the binary.

Subsequent evolution will likely drive SW1's orbit out of the Gateway region, perhaps becoming one of the largest JFCs in recorded history. The JFC Gateway region coincides with a heliocentric distance range where the activity of observed cometary bodies increases significantly. SW1's activity may be typical of the early evolutionary processing experienced by most JFCs.

We use spatially resolved CO isotopologue line observations and detailed thermo-chemical models to derive CO abundance structures. We find that the CO abundance varies with radius by an order of magnitude in these disks. We show that although chemical processes can efficiently reduce the total column of CO gas within 1 Myr under an ISM level of cosmic-ray ionization rate, the depletion mostly occurs at the deep region of a disk. Without sufficient vertical mixing, the surface layer is not depleted enough to reproduce weak CO emissions observed. The radial profiles of CO depletion in three disks are qualitatively consistent with predictions of pebble formation, settling, and drifting in disks. But the dust evolution alone cannot fully explain the high depletion observed in some disks.

The absence of metals prevents catastrophic cooling, suppresses fragmentation, and may allow for the formation of massive black hole seeds. Here we report on the abundance of pristine atomic cooling haloes found and on the specific physical conditions that allow for the formation of these direct-collapse-black-hole (DCBH) haloes. In total in our simulations we find that 79 DCBH haloes form before a redshift of 11.6. We find that the formation of pristine atomic haloes is driven by the rapid assembly of the atomic cooling haloes with mergers, both minor and/or major, prior to reaching the atomic cooling limit a requirement. However, the ability of assembling haloes to remain free of (external) metal enrichment is equally important and underlines the necessity of following the transport of metals in such simulations. The candidate DCBH hosting haloes we find, have been exposed to mean Lyman-Werner radiation fields of J$_{LW}$ $\sim$ 1 J$_{21}$ and typically lie at least 10 kpc (physical) from the nearest massive galaxy. Growth rates of the haloes reach values of greater than 10$^7$ M$_{\odot}$ per unit redshift, leading to significant dynamical heating and the suppression of efficient cooling until the halo crosses the atomic cooling threshold. Finally, we also find five synchronised halo candidates where pairs of pristine atomic cooling haloes emerge that are both spatially and temporally synchronised.

We also observe a factor of 75 change in flux over a 2-hour time span with no obvious color changes between 1.6 $\mu$m and 2.1 $\mu$m.

Using the most comprehensive statistical model published, the probability of a single night exhibiting peak flux levels observed this year, given historical Keck observations, is less than $0.3\%$. The probability to observe the flux levels similar to all 4 nights of data in 2019 is less than $0.05\%$. This increase in brightness and variability may indicate a period of heightened activity from Sgr A* or a change in its accretion state. It may also indicate that the current model is not sufficient to model Sgr A* at high flux levels and should be updated. Potential physical origins of Sgr A*'s unprecedented brightness may be from changes in the accretion-flow as a result of the star S0-2's closest passage to the black hole in 2018 or from a delayed reaction to the approach of the dusty object G2 in 2014.

Multi-model ensemble forecasts---weighted combinations of component models---have shown positive results in forecasting. Ensemble forecasts of influenza outbreaks have been static, training on all past ILI data at the beginning of a season, generating a set of optimal weights for each model in the ensemble, and keeping the weights constant. We propose an adaptive ensemble forecast that (i) changes model weights week-by-week throughout the influenza season, (ii) only needs the current influenza season's data to make predictions, and (iii) by introducing a prior distribution, shrinks weights toward the reference equal weighting approach and adjusts for observed ILI percentages that are subject to future revisions. We investigate the prior's ability to impact adaptive ensemble performance and, after finding an optimal prior via a cross-validation approach, compare our adaptive ensemble's performance to equal-weighted and static ensembles. Applied to forecasts of short-term ILI incidence at the regional and national level in the US, our adaptive model outperforms a naive equal-weighted ensemble, and has similar or better performance to the static ensemble, which requires multiple years of training data. Adaptive ensembles are able to quickly train and forecast during epidemics, and provide a practical tool to public health officials looking for forecasts that can conform to unique features of a specific season.

Although we focus on the interaction in the dark sector, any significant deviation from the standard model that changes the expansion history of the Universe, should leave imprints detectable by our analysis. Thus, detecting signatures of interaction could also be indicative of other non-standard phenomena even if they are not the results of the interaction. It is thus interesting to note that the results presented in this paper do not provide support for the interaction in the dark sector, although the uncertainty is still quite large. In so far as interaction is present but undetectable using current data, we show from a Fisher forecast that forthcoming LSST and DESI surveys will be able to constrain a DM-DE coupling at $20\%$ precision --- enough to falsify the non-interacting scenario, assuming the presence of a modest amount of interaction.

We find that the impact on direct detection can be sizable, with a probability of $\sim 10^{-3}$ to find an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ enhancement of the recoil rate. In the case of the capture rate in the Sun, we find that $\mathcal{O}(1)$ enhancements are very unlikely, with probability $\lesssim 10^{-5}$, and are even impossible for some dark matter masses.

This result treated all isolated vertices as having self-loops, so they all evolved by a phase under the quantum walk. In this paper, we permit isolated vertices to be loopless or looped, and loopless isolated vertices do not evolve at all under the quantum walk. Using this distinction, we construct simpler dynamic graphs that implement the Pauli gates and a set of universal quantum gates consisting of the Hadamard, $T$, and CNOT gates, and these gates are easily extended to multi-qubit systems. For example, the $T$ gate is simplified from a sequence of six graphs to a single graph, and the number of vertices is reduced by a factor of four. We also construct a generalized phase gate, of which $Z$, $S$, and $T$ are specific instances. Finally, we validate our implementations by numerically simulating a quantum circuit consisting of layers of one- and two-qubit gates, similar to those in recent quantum supremacy experiments, using a quantum walk.

We employ a left coronary artery model with deformable vessel walls, simulated via an ALE framework for FSI, with a prescribed inlet pressure and open-loop lumped parameter network outlet boundary conditions. Stochastic modeling of the uncertain inputs is determined from intra-coronary catheterization data or gathered from the literature. Uncertainty propagation is performed using several approaches including Monte Carlo, Quasi MC, stochastic collocation, and multiwavelet stochastic expansion. Variabilities in QoI, including branch pressure, flow, wall shear stress, and wall deformation are assessed. We find that uncertainty in inlet pressures and intramyocardial pressures significantly affect all resulting QoIs, while uncertainty in elastic modulus only affects the mechanical response of the vascular wall. Variability in the morphometry exponent has little effect on coronary hemodynamics or wall mechanics. Finally, we compare convergence behaviors of statistics of QoIs using several uncertainty propagation methods. From the simulation results, we conclude that the multi-wavelet stochastic expansion shows superior accuracy and performance against Quasi Monte Carlo and stochastic collocation methods.

We then use 9.5 sq.~deg.~of Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Redshift Survey data to map {\it galaxy\/} environmental densities over $0.2<z<1.5$ ($\sim$7~Gyr) and infer $\alpha=1.98\pm0.04$ and $\beta=2.01\pm0.11$---consistent with our analytic prediction. These findings---enabled by swapping the Eulerian domain of most work on density growth for a Lagrangian approach to real-space volumetric averages---provide some of the strongest evidence that a lognormal distribution of early density fluctuations indeed decoupled from cosmic expansion to grow through gravitational accretion. They also comprise the first exact, analytic description of the nonlinear growth of structure extensible to (arbitrarily) low redshift. We hope these results open the door to new modeling of, and insight-building into, the diversity of galaxy growth in cosmological contexts. ","] Gravity and the nonlinear growth of structure in the

Therefore, it is difficult to generalize these performance improvements to other types of graphs. Given a graph, it is currently impossible to quantify the advantages of one approach over another.

Our goal is threefold: (i) provide a unifying framework for comparing the performance of various graph embedding methods, (ii) establish a benchmark with real-world graphs that exhibit different structural properties, and (iii) provide users with a tool to identify the best graph embedding method for their data. This paper evaluates 4 of the most influential graph embedding methods and 4 traditional link prediction methods against a corpus of 100 real-world networks with varying properties. We organize the 100 networks in terms of their properties to get a better understanding of the embedding performance of these popular methods.

We determine $\xi_c$ from the monomer structure factor and from the radial distribution function, and find that the identification $\xi=\xi_c$ is not justified outside of the semidilute regime. In order to better characterize $\xi$, we compute the pore size distribution (PSD) following two different definitions, one by Torquato et al. (Ref.1) and one by Gubbins et al. (Ref.2).

This identification allows to interpret the PSD as the distribution of mesh sizes, a quantity which conventional methods cannot access.

Specifically, we employ a minimally constrained matrix decomposition method (non-negative matrix factorization) to simultaneously identify regularized, covarying subgraphs of functional connectivity, to assess their similarity to task performance, and to detect their time-varying expression. Individuals also displayed marked variation in the spatial properties of subgraphs such as the connectivity between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain, and in the temporal properties of subgraphs such as the stage of learning at which they reached maximum expression. From these observations, we posit a conceptual model in which certain subgraphs support learning by modulating brain activity in regions important for sustaining attention.

There is some overlap among these groups, as some display several types of oscillations. Despite many of these systems are likely to be false positives, i. e., when an EB light curve is blended with a pulsator, this catalog gathers a vast sample of systems that are valuable for a better understanding of stellar evolution.

After considering and rejecting a stellar origin for this source, we discovered a new millisecond pulsar (MSP) using observations from the Parkes radio telescope. This pulsar has period 2.77 ms and dispersion measure 228.27 pc/cm**3. Although this pulsar does not yet appear to be particularly remarkable, the short spin period, wide profile and high dispersion measure do make it relatively hard to discover through traditional blind periodicity searches. Over the course of several weeks we see changes in the barycentric period of this pulsar that are consistent with orbital motion in a binary system, but the properties of any binary need to be confirmed by further observations. While even a deep ASKAP survey may not identify large numbers of new MSPs compared to the existing population, it would be competitive with existing all-sky surveys and could discover interesting new MSPs at high Galactic latitude without the need for computationally-expensive all-sky periodicity searches.
