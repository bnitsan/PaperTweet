They are more inherently intuitive to humans to both produce and comprehend. We propose a methodology to produce contrastive explanations for classification models by modifying the representation to disregard non-contrastive information, and modifying model behavior to only be based on contrastive reasoning. Our method is based on projecting model representation to a latent space that captures only the features that are useful (to the model) to differentiate two potential decisions. We demonstrate the value of contrastive explanations by analyzing two different scenarios, using both high-level abstract concept attribution and low-level input token/span attribution, on two widely used text classification tasks. Specifically, we produce explanations for answering: for which label, and against which alternative label, is some aspect of the input useful? And which aspects of the input are useful for and against particular decisions? Overall, our findings shed light on the ability of label-contrastive explanations to provide a more accurate and finer-grained interpretability of a model's decision.

Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has the potential to improve contrast, reduce artifacts and the ability to perform material decomposition in advanced imaging applications. The increased number or measurements results with a higher radiation dose and it is therefore essential to reduce either number of projections per energy or the source X-ray intensity, but this makes tomographic reconstruction more ill-posed. Approach. We developed the multi-channel convolutional analysis operator learning (MCAOL) method to exploit common spatial features within attenuation images at different energies and we propose an optimization method which jointly reconstructs the attenuation images at low and high energies with a mixed norm regularization on the sparse features obtained by pre-trained convolutional filters through the convolutional analysis operator learning (CAOL) algorithm. Main results. Extensive experiments with simulated and real computed tomography (CT) data were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and we reported increased reconstruction accuracy compared to CAOL and iterative methods with single and joint total-variation (TV) regularization. Significance. Qualitative and quantitative results on sparse-views and low-dose DECT demonstrate that the proposed MCAOL method outperforms both CAOL applied on each energy independently and several existing state-of-the-art model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) techniques, thus paving the way for dose reduction.

An axion field coupled to electromagnetism predicts a nearly frequency-independent birefringence angle, $\beta_\nu = \beta$, while Faraday rotation from local magnetic fields and Lorentz violating theories predict a cosmic birefringence angle that is proportional to the frequency, $\nu$, to the power of some integer $n$, $\beta_\nu \propto \nu^n$. In this work, we first sample $\beta_\nu$ individually for each polarized HFI frequency band in addition to the 70 GHz channel from the LFI. We also constrain a power-law formula for the birefringence angle, $\beta_\nu=\beta_0(\nu/\nu_0)^n$, with $\nu_0 = 150$ GHz. For a nearly full-sky measurement, $f_{\text{sky}}=0.93$, we find $\beta_0 = 0.26^{\circ}\pm0.11^\circ$ $(68\% \text{ C.L.})$ and $n=-0.45^{+0.61}_{-0.82}$ when we ignore the intrinsic $EB$ correlations of the polarized foreground emission, and $\beta_0 = 0.33^\circ \pm 0.12^\circ$ and $n=-0.37^{+0.49}_{-0.64}$ when we use a filamentary dust model for the foreground $EB$. Next, we use all the polarized Planck maps, including the 30 and 44 GHz frequency bands. These bands have a negligible foreground contribution from polarized dust emission. We, therefore, treat them separately. Without any modeling of the intrinsic $EB$ of the foreground, we generally find that the inclusion of the 30 and 44 GHz frequency bands raises the measured values of $\beta_\nu$ and tightens $n$. At nearly full-sky, we measure $\beta_0=0.29^{\circ+0.10^\circ}_{\phantom{\circ}-0.11^\circ}$ and $n=-0.35^{+0.48}_{-0.47}$. Assuming no frequency dependence, we measure $\beta=0.33^\circ \pm 0.10^\circ$.

We investigate how the oblateness and a changing gravitational acceleration affect different hydrodynamic modes that exist in such fluid layers through analytic approximations and numerical calculations. The wave vectors of $g$-modes and Yanai modes increase for more oblate systems compared to spherical counterparts, although the impact of variations in the changing gravitational acceleration is effectively negligible. We find that for increased oblateness, Kelvin modes show less equatorial confinement and little change in their wave vector.

We draw parallels to the study of evolvable genomes in evolutionary systems -- genomes with a strong capacity to adapt -- and propose that meta-learning and adaptive evolvability optimize for the same objective: high performance after a set of learning iterations. We argue that population-based evolutionary systems with non-static fitness landscapes naturally bias towards high-evolvability genomes, and therefore optimize for populations with strong learning ability. We demonstrate this claim with a simple evolutionary algorithm, Population-Based Meta Learning (PBML), that consistently discovers genomes which display higher rates of improvement over generations, and can rapidly adapt to solve sparse fitness and robotic control tasks.

Recent experimental demonstrations of their detection using electron spins in diamond pave the way towards studying the back-action of a controllable paramagnetic spin bath on the spin waves. Here, we present a quantum theory describing the interaction between spin waves and paramagnetic spins. As a case study we consider an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond in the vicinity of an Yttrium-Iron-Garnet thin film. We show how the back-action of the ensemble results in strong and tuneable modifications of the spin-wave spectrum and propagation properties. These modifications include the full suppression of spin-wave propagation and, in a different parameter regime, the enhancement of their propagation length by $\sim 50\%$. Furthermore, we show how the spin wave thermal fluctuations induce a measurable frequency shift of the paramagnetic spins in the bath. This shift results in a thermal dispersion force that can be measured optically and/or mechanically with a diamond mechanical resonator. In addition, we use our theory to compute the spin wave-mediated interaction between the spins in the bath. We show that all the above effects are measurable by state-of-the-art experiments. Our results provide the theoretical foundation for describing hybrid quantum systems of spin waves and spin baths, and establish the potential of quantum spins as active control, sensing, and interfacing tools for spintronics.

The latter often consists on short and noisy trajectories, which are hard to characterize with usual statistical approaches. In recent years, we have witnessed an impressive effort to bridge theory and experiments by means of supervised machine learning techniques, with astonishing results. In this work, we explore the use of unsupervised methods in anomalous diffusion data. We show that the main diffusion characteristics can be learnt without the need of any labelling of the data. We use such method to discriminate between anomalous diffusion models and extract their physical parameters. Moreover, we explore the feasibility of finding novel types of diffusion, in this case represented by compositions of existing diffusion models.

We argue that to support these goals, an agent would benefit from an episodic memory; that is, a memory that encodes the agent's experience in such a way that the agent can relive the experience, communicate about it and use its past experience, inclusive of the agents own past actions, to learn more effective models and policies.

In this work, we propose realistic and efficient strategies to detect radiative products from dark-matter decays with line-intensity mapping (LIM) experiments. This radiation will behave as a line interloper for the atomic and molecular spectral lines targeted by LIM surveys. The most distinctive signatures of the contribution from dark-matter radiative decays are an extra anisotropy on the LIM power spectrum due to projection effects, as well as a narrowing and a shift towards higher intensities of the voxel intensity distribution. We forecast the minimum rate of decays into two photons that LIM surveys will be sensitive to as function of the dark-matter mass in the range $\sim 10^{-6}-10$ eV, and discuss how to reinterpret such results for dark matter that decays into a photon and another particle. We find that both the power spectrum and the voxel intensity distribution are expected to be very sensitive to the dark-matter contribution, with the voxel intensity distribution being more promising for most experiments considered. Interpreting our results in terms of the axion, we show that LIM surveys will be extremely competitive to detect its decay products, improving several orders of magnitudes (depending on the mass) the sensitivity of laboratory and astrophysical searches, especially in the mass range $\sim 1-10$ eV.

As leave-one-out cross-validation is based on finite observed data, there is uncertainty about the expected predictive performance on new data. By modeling this uncertainty when comparing two models, we can compute the probability that one model has a better predictive performance than the other. Modeling this uncertainty well is not trivial, and for example, it is known that the commonly used standard error estimate is often too small. We study the properties of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator and the related uncertainty estimates when comparing two models. We provide new results of the properties both theoretically in the linear regression case and empirically for multiple different models and discuss the challenges of modeling the uncertainty. We show that problematic cases include: comparing models with similar predictions, misspecified models, and small data. In these cases, there is a weak connection in the skewness of the individual leave-one-out terms and the distribution of the error of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator. We show that it is possible that the problematic skewness of the error distribution, which occurs when the models make similar predictions, does not fade away when the data size grows to infinity in certain situations.

To do this, we combine arcsecond resolution CO data from PHANGS-ALMA with multi-wavelength data that traces the atomic gas, stellar structure, and star formation rate (SFR) for 28 nearby star-forming galaxies. We find that $P_\mathrm{turb}$ correlates with, but almost always exceeds the estimated $P_\mathrm{DE}$ on kiloparsec scales. This indicates that the molecular gas is over-pressurized relative to the large-scale environment. We show that this over-pressurization can be explained by the clumpy nature of molecular gas; a revised estimate of $P_\mathrm{DE}$ on cloud scales, which accounts for molecular gas self-gravity, external gravity, and ambient pressure, agrees well with the observed $P_\mathrm{turb}$ in galaxy disks. We also find that molecular gas with cloud-scale ${P_\mathrm{turb}}\approx{P_\mathrm{DE}}\gtrsim{10^5\,k_\mathrm{B}\,\mathrm{K\,cm^{-3}}}$ in our sample is more likely to be self-gravitating, whereas gas at lower pressure appears more influenced by ambient pressure and/or external gravity. Furthermore, we show that the ratio between $P_\mathrm{turb}$ and the observed SFR surface density, $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$, is compatible with stellar feedback-driven momentum injection in most cases, while a subset of the regions may show evidence of turbulence driven by additional sources. The correlation between $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and kpc-scale $P_\mathrm{DE}$ in galaxy disks is consistent with the expectation from self-regulated star formation models.

In the context of classifying sleep status from actigraphy, Webster's rescoring rules offer one popular solution based on the long-term patterns in the output of a moving-window model. Unfortunately, the question of how to optimize rescoring rules for any given setting has remained unsolved. To address this problem and expand the possible use cases of rescoring rules, we propose rephrasing these rules in terms of epoch-specific features. Our features take two general forms: (1) the time lag between now and the most recent [or closest upcoming] bout of time spent in a given state, and (2) the length of the most recent [or closest upcoming] bout of time spent in a given state. Given any initial moving window model, these features can be defined recursively, allowing for straightforward optimization of rescoring rules. Joint optimization of the moving window model and the subsequent rescoring rules can also be implemented using gradient-based optimization software, such as Tensorflow. Beyond binary classification problems (e.g., sleep-wake), the same approach can be applied to summarize long-term patterns for multi-state classification problems (e.g., sitting, walking, or stair climbing). We find that optimized rescoring rules improve the performance of sleep-wake classifiers, achieving accuracy comparable to that of certain neural network architectures.

To capture their spatial-temporal dependencies, we propose a recurrent neural network with a novel Transformer architecture, which we call the Interaction Transformer. Importantly, our model can be trained end-to-end, and runs in real-time. We validate our approach on two challenging real-world datasets: ATG4D and nuScenes. We show that our approach can outperform the state-of-the-art on both datasets. In particular, we significantly improve the social compliance between the estimated future trajectories, resulting in far fewer collisions between the predicted actors.
