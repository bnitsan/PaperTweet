Unlike in other domains, compiler and AI researchers do not have access to the datasets and frameworks that enable fast iteration and development of ideas, and getting started requires a significant engineering investment. What is needed is an easy, reusable experimental infrastructure for real world compiler optimization tasks that can serve as a common benchmark for comparing techniques, and as a platform to accelerate progress in the field. We introduce CompilerGym, a set of environments for real world compiler optimization tasks, and a toolkit for exposing new optimization tasks to compiler researchers. CompilerGym enables anyone to experiment on production compiler optimization problems through an easy-to-use package, regardless of their experience with compilers. We build upon the popular OpenAI Gym interface enabling researchers to interact with compilers using Python and a familiar API. We describe the CompilerGym architecture and implementation, characterize the optimization spaces and computational efficiencies of three included compiler environments, and provide extensive empirical evaluations. Compared to prior works, CompilerGym offers larger datasets and optimization spaces, is 27x more computationally efficient, is fault-tolerant, and capable of detecting reproducibility bugs in the underlying compilers. In making it easy for anyone to experiment with compilers - irrespective of their background - we aim to accelerate progress in the AI and compiler research domains.

Understanding how to develop sustainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers -- the people actively developing software in an academic research environment -- subjectively define software sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: \emph{intrinsic sustainability}, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and \emph{extrinsic sustainability}, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared.

In previous information-geometric studies, the $q$-exponential family was analyzed using classical convex duality and Bregman divergence. In this paper, we show that a generalized $\lambda$-duality, where $\lambda = 1 - q$ is the constant information-geometric curvature, leads to a generalized exponential family which is essentially equivalent to the $q$-exponential family and has deep connections with R\'{e}nyi entropy and optimal transport. Using this generalized convex duality and its associated logarithmic divergence, we show that our $\lambda$-exponential family satisfies properties that parallel and generalize those of the exponential family. Under our framework, the R\'{e}nyi entropy and divergence arise naturally, and we give a new proof of the Tsallis/R\'{e}nyi entropy maximizing property of the $q$-exponential family.

Scaling has been a powerful tool for revealing systematic regularities in systems across a range of topics from physics and biology to cities, and for understanding the underlying principles of their organization and growth. Here, we apply this framework to institutions of higher learning in the United States and show that, like organisms, ecosystems and cities, they scale in a surprisingly systematic fashion following simple power law behavior. We analyze the entire spectrum encompassing 5,802 institutions ranging from large research universities to small professional schools, organized in seven commonly used sectors, which reveal distinct regimes of institutional scaling behavior. Metrics include variation in expenditures, revenues, graduation rates and estimated economic added value, expressed as functions of total enrollment, our fundamental measure of size. Our results quantify how each regime of institution leverages specific economies of scale to address distinct priorities. Taken together, the scaling of features within a sector and shifts in scaling across sectors implies that there are generic mechanisms and constraints shared by all sectors which lead to tradeoffs between their different societal functions and roles. We particularly highlight the strong complementarity between public and private research universities, and community and state colleges, four sectors that display superlinear returns to scale.

The star cluster catalogues are from the Legacy ExtraGalactic UV Survey (LEGUS) and the molecular clouds from the Plateau de Bure Interefrometer Arcsecond Whirpool Survey (PAWS). We find that younger star clusters are spatially closer to molecular clouds than older star clusters. The median ages for clusters associated with clouds is 4~Myr whereas it is 50~Myr for clusters that are sufficiently separated from a molecular cloud to be considered unassociated. After $\sim$6~Myr, the majority of the star clusters lose association with their molecular gas. Younger star clusters are also preferentially located in stellar spiral arms where they are hierarchically distributed in kpc-size regions for 50-100~Myr before dispersing. The youngest star clusters are more strongly clustered, yielding a two-point correlation function with $\alpha=-0.28\pm0.04$, than the GMCs ($\alpha=-0.09\pm0.03$) within the same PAWS field. However, the clustering strength of the most massive GMCs, supposedly the progenitors of the young clusters for a star formation efficiency of a few percent, is comparable ($\alpha=-0.35\pm0.05$) to that of the clusters. We find a galactocentric-dependence for the coherence of star formation, in which clusters located in the inner region of the galaxy reside in smaller star-forming complexes and display more homogeneous distributions than clusters further from the centre.

By using a neural inference network to approximate the model's posterior on latent variables, VAEs efficiently parameterize a lower bound on marginal data likelihood that can be optimized directly via gradient methods. In practice, however, VAE training often results in a degenerate local optimum known as ""posterior collapse"" where the model learns to ignore the latent variable and the approximate posterior mimics the prior. In this paper, we investigate posterior collapse from the perspective of training dynamics. We find that during the initial stages of training the inference network fails to approximate the model's true posterior, which is a moving target. As a result, the model is encouraged to ignore the latent encoding and posterior collapse occurs. Based on this observation, we propose an extremely simple modification to VAE training to reduce inference lag: depending on the model's current mutual information between latent variable and observation, we aggressively optimize the inference network before performing each model update. Despite introducing neither new model components nor significant complexity over basic VAE, our approach is able to avoid the problem of collapse that has plagued a large amount of previous work. Empirically, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines on text and image benchmarks in terms of held-out likelihood, and is competitive with more complex techniques for avoiding collapse while being substantially faster.

Both giants orbit more massive but less luminous companions, previously proposed to be mass-gap black holes. Spectral disentangling reveals luminous companions with star-like spectra in both systems. Joint modeling of the spectra, light curves, and spectral energy distributions robustly constrains the masses, temperatures, and radii of both components: the primaries are luminous, cool giants ($T_{\rm eff,\,giant} = 3,800\,\rm K$ and $4,000\,\rm K$, $R_{\rm giant}= 22.5\,R_{\odot}$ and $25\,R_{\odot}$) with exceptionally low masses ($M_{\rm giant} \approx 0.4\,M_{\odot}$) that likely fill their Roche lobes. The secondaries are only slightly warmer subgiants ($T_{\rm eff,\,2} = 5,800\,\rm K$ and $5,150\,\rm K$, $R_2= 8.3\,R_{\odot}$ and $9\,R_{\odot}$) and thus are consistent with observed UV limits that would rule out main-sequence stars with similar masses ($M_2 \approx 2.8\,M_{\odot}$ and $\approx 1.8\,M_{\odot}$). In the Unicorn, rapid rotation blurs the spectral lines of the subgiant, making it challenging to detect even at wavelengths where it dominates the total light. Both giants have surface abundances indicative of CNO processing and subsequent envelope stripping. The properties of both systems can be reproduced by binary evolution models in which a $1-2\,M_{\odot}$ primary is stripped by a companion as it ascends the giant branch. The fact that the companions are also evolved implies either that the initial mass ratio was very near unity, or that the companions are temporarily inflated due to rapid accretion. The Unicorn and Giraffe offer a window into into a rarely-observed phase of binary evolution preceding the formation of wide-orbit helium white dwarfs, and eventually, compact binaries containing two helium white dwarfs.

We demonstrate here a new inference method that solves this problem by sampling the exact Bayesian posterior of any desired cosmological parameters, of the gravitational lensing potential, and of the delensed CMB maps, given lensed temperature and polarization data. We validate the method using simulated CMB data with non-white noise and masking on up to 650\,deg$^2$ patches of sky. A unique strength of this approach is the ability to jointly estimate cosmological parameters which control both the primordial CMB and the lensing potential, which we demonstrate here for the first time by sampling both the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and the amplitude of the lensing potential, $A_\phi$. The method allows us to perform the most precise check to-date of several important approximations underlying CMB-S4 $r$ forecasting, and we confirm these yield the correct expected uncertainty on $r$ to better than 10%.

But this mechanism has not been effective in promoting widespread shifting of appliance usage. Here we consider an alternative decentralised mechanism, where agents receive an initial allocation of time-slots to use their appliances and can then exchange these with other agents. If agents are willing to be more flexible in the exchanges they accept, then overall satisfaction, in terms of the percentage of agents time-slot preferences that are satisfied, will increase. This requires a mechanism that can incentivise agents to be more flexible. Building on previous work, we show that a mechanism incorporating social capital - the tracking of favours given and received - can incentivise agents to act flexibly and give favours by accepting exchanges that do not immediately benefit them. We demonstrate that a mechanism that tracks favours increases the overall satisfaction of agents, and crucially allows social agents that give favours to outcompete selfish agents that do not under payoff-biased social learning.

Our approach proposes separate methods for modelling the bodies and tails of the distributions of both wildfire variables. For the former, a hierarchical clustering technique is proposed to first group similar locations, with a non-parametric approach subsequently used to model the non-extreme data. To capture tail behaviour, separate techniques derived from univariate extreme value theory are proposed for both variables. For the count data, a generalised Pareto distribution with a generalised additive model structure is used to capture effects from covariates on values above a high threshold. For burnt area, a non-stationary generalised Pareto distribution enables us to capture the tail behaviour of proportions obtained through a transformation of observed area data. The resulting predictions are shown to perform reasonably well, improving on the benchmark method proposed in the challenge outline. We also provide a discussion about the limitations of our modelling framework and evaluate ways in which it could be extended. ","A flexible, semi-parametric, cluster-based approach for predicting

Many current explanation methods, such as gradient-based or Shapley value-based methods, provide measures of importance which are well-understood mathematically. But how does a person receiving the explanation (the explainee) comprehend it? And does their understanding match what the explanation attempted to communicate? We empirically investigate the effect of various factors of the input, the feature-attribution explanation, and visualization procedure, on laypeople's interpretation of the explanation. We query crowdworkers for their interpretation on tasks in English and German, and fit a GAMM model to their responses considering the factors of interest. We find that people often mis-interpret the explanations: superficial and unrelated factors, such as word length, influence the explainees' importance assignment despite the explanation communicating importance directly. We then show that some of this distortion can be attenuated: we propose a method to adjust saliencies based on model estimates of over- and under-perception, and explore bar charts as an alternative to heatmap saliency visualization.

It is often implicitly assumed that the poisoned classifier is vulnerable exclusively to the adversary who possesses the trigger. In this paper, we show empirically that this view of backdoored classifiers is incorrect. We describe a new threat model for poisoned classifier, where one without knowledge of the original trigger, would want to control the poisoned classifier. Under this threat model, we propose a test-time, human-in-the-loop attack method to generate multiple effective alternative triggers without access to the initial backdoor and the training data. We construct these alternative triggers by first generating adversarial examples for a smoothed version of the classifier, created with a procedure called Denoised Smoothing, and then extracting colors or cropped portions of smoothed adversarial images with human interaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack through extensive experiments on high-resolution datasets: ImageNet and TrojAI. We also compare our approach to previous work on modeling trigger distributions and find that our method are more scalable and efficient in generating effective triggers. Last, we include a user study which demonstrates that our method allows users to easily determine the existence of such backdoors in existing poisoned classifiers. Thus, we argue that there is no such thing as a secret backdoor in poisoned classifiers: poisoning a classifier invites attacks not just by the party that possesses the trigger, but from anyone with access to the classifier.

Because of the complexity of research software, developers cannot conduct exhaustive testing. As a result, researchers have lower confidence in the correctness of the output of the software. Peer code review, a standard software engineering practice, has helped address this problem in other types of software. Aims: Peer code review is less prevalent in research software than it is in other types of software. In addition, the literature does not contain any studies about the use of peer code review in research software. Therefore, through analyzing developers perceptions, the goal of this work is to understand the current practice of peer code review in the development of research software, identify challenges and barriers associated with peer code review in research software, and present approaches to improve the peer code review in research software. Method: We conducted interviews and a community survey of research software developers to collect information about their current peer code review practices, difficulties they face, and how they address those difficulties. Results: We received 84 unique responses from the interviews and surveys. The results show that while research software teams review a large amount of their code, they lack formal process, proper organization, and adequate people to perform the reviews. Conclusions: Use of peer code review is promising for improving the quality of research software and thereby improving the trustworthiness of the underlying research results.

Researchers employed machine learning methods using hand-crafted features for seizure prediction. However, ML methods are too complicated to select the best ML model or best features. Deep Learning methods are beneficial in the sense of automatic feature extraction. One of the roadblocks for accurate seizure prediction is scarcity of epileptic seizure data. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic EEG samples. We use two methods to validate synthesized data namely, one-class SVM and a new proposal which we refer to as convolutional epileptic seizure predictor (CESP). Another objective of our study is to evaluate performance of well-known deep learning models (e.g., VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3) by training models on augmented data using transfer learning with average time of 10 min between true prediction and seizure onset. Our results show that CESP model achieves sensitivity of 78.11% and 88.21%, and FPR of 0.27/h and 0.14/h for training on synthesized and testing on real Epilepsyecosystem and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Effective results of CESP trained on synthesized data shows that synthetic data acquired the correlation between features and labels very well.

RAABBVI is based on rigorously justified automation techniques, includes just a small number of intuitive tuning parameters, and detects inaccurate estimates of the optimal variational approximation. RAABBVI adaptively decreases the learning rate by detecting convergence of the fixed--learning-rate iterates, then estimates the symmetrized Kullback--Leiber (KL) divergence between the current variational approximation and the optimal one. It also employs a novel optimization termination criterion that enables the user to balance desired accuracy against computational cost by comparing (i) the predicted relative decrease in the symmetrized KL divergence if a smaller learning were used and (ii) the predicted computation required to converge with the smaller learning rate. We validate the robustness and accuracy of RAABBVI through carefully designed simulation studies and on a diverse set of real-world model and data examples.

So far, experiments to check the chirality of matter or nanostructures have been carried out using free-space propagating light beams. However, for the sake of miniaturization, it would be desirable to perform chiral spectroscopy in photonic integrated platforms, with the additional benefit of massive parallel detection, low-cost production, repeatability, and portability of such a chiroptical device. Here we show that all-dielectric integrated photonic waveguides can support chiral modes under proper combination of the fundamental eigenmodes. In particular, we investigate two mainstream configurations: a dielectric wire with square cross-section and a slotted waveguide. We analyze numerically three different scenarios in which such waveguides could be used for chiral detection: all-dielectric waveguides as near-field probes, evanescent-induced chiral fields, and chiroptical interaction in void slots. In all the cases we consider a metallic nanohelix as a chiral probe, though all the approaches can be extended to other kinds of chiral nanostructures as well as matter. Our results establish that chiral applications such as sensing and spectroscopy could be realized in standard integrated optics, in particular, with silicon-based technology.

We argue for the existence of the ""break-even"" point on this trajectory, beyond which the curvature of the loss surface and noise in the gradient are implicitly regularized by SGD. In particular, we demonstrate on multiple classification tasks that using a large learning rate in the initial phase of training reduces the variance of the gradient, and improves the conditioning of the covariance of gradients. These effects are beneficial from the optimization perspective and become visible after the break-even point. Complementing prior work, we also show that using a low learning rate results in bad conditioning of the loss surface even for a neural network with batch normalization layers. In short, our work shows that key properties of the loss surface are strongly influenced by SGD in the early phase of training.

They must consume as little energy as possible (be energy-efficient or economical) but at the same time fulfil their functions (be functionally effective). Neurons displaying best performance for such multi-task trade-offs are said to be Pareto optimal. However, it is not understood how ion channel parameters contribute to the Pareto optimal performance of neurons. Ion channel degeneracy implies that multiple combinations of ion channel parameters can lead to functionally similar neuronal behavior. Therefore, to simulate functional behavior, instead of a single model, neuroscientists often use populations of valid models with distinct ion conductance configurations. This approach is called population (also database or ensemble) modeling. It remains unclear, which ion channel parameters in a vast population of functional models are more likely to be found in the brain. Here we propose that Pareto optimality can serve as a guiding principle for addressing this issue. The Pareto optimum concept can help identify the subpopulations of conductance-based models with ion channel configurations that perform best for the trade-off between economy and functional effectiveness. In this way, the high-dimensional parameter space of neuronal models might be reduced to geometrically simple low-dimensional manifolds. Therefore, Pareto optimality is a promising framework for improving population modeling of neurons and their circuits. We also discuss how Pareto inference might help deduce neuronal functions from high-dimensional Patch-seq data.

The search was conducted using an algorithm that nearly automates the detection of diffuse dwarf galaxies.

Unfortunately, much of the cosmological information is encoded by the small scales, where the clustering of dark matter and the effects of astrophysical feedback processes are not fully understood. This can bias the estimates of cosmological parameters, which we study here for a joint analysis of mock Euclid cosmic shear and Planck cosmic microwave background data. We use different implementations for the modelling of the signal on small scales and find that they result in significantly different predictions. Moreover, the different nonlinear corrections lead to biased parameter estimates, especially when the analysis is extended into the highly nonlinear regime, with both the Hubble constant, $H_0$, and the clustering amplitude, $\sigma_8$, affected the most. Improvements in the modelling of nonlinear scales will therefore be needed if we are to resolve the current tension with more and better data. For a given prescription for the nonlinear power spectrum, using different corrections for baryon physics does not significantly impact the precision of Euclid, but neglecting these correction does lead to large biases in the cosmological parameters. In order to extract precise and unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters from Euclid cosmic shear data, it is therefore essential to improve the accuracy of the recipes that account for nonlinear structure formation, as well as the modelling of the impact of astrophysical processes that redistribute the baryons.

In this work, we analyze the memory and cache subsystem and study Rowhammer and cache attacks enabled on two proposed heterogeneous FPGA-CPU platforms by Intel: the Arria 10 GX with an integrated FPGA-CPU platform, and the Arria 10 GX PAC expansion card which connects the FPGA to the CPU via the PCIe interface. We show that while Intel PACs currently are immune to cache attacks from FPGA to CPU, the integrated platform is indeed vulnerable to Prime and Probe style attacks from the FPGA to the CPU's last level cache. Further, we demonstrate JackHammer, a novel and efficient Rowhammer from the FPGA to the host's main memory. Our results indicate that a malicious FPGA can perform twice as fast as a typical Rowhammer attack from the CPU on the same system and causes around four times as many bit flips as the CPU attack. We demonstrate the efficacy of JackHammer from the FPGA through a realistic fault attack on the WolfSSL RSA signing implementation that reliably causes a fault after an average of fifty-eight RSA signatures, 25% faster than a CPU rowhammer attack. In some scenarios our JackHammer attack produces faulty signatures more than three times more often and almost three times faster than a conventional CPU rowhammer attack.

We approach this question by focusing on individual neurons, analyzing the behavior of their activations at different timescales. We show that signal processing provides a natural framework for separating structure across scales, enabling us to 1) disentangle scale-specific information in existing embeddings and 2) train models to learn more about particular scales. Concretely, we apply spectral filters to the activations of a neuron across an input, producing filtered embeddings that perform well on part of speech tagging (word-level), dialog speech acts classification (utterance-level), or topic classification (document-level), while performing poorly on the other tasks. We also present a prism layer for training models, which uses spectral filters to constrain different neurons to model structure at different scales. Our proposed BERT + Prism model can better predict masked tokens using long-range context and produces multiscale representations that perform better at utterance- and document-level tasks.

Wielded correctly, though, noncommutation can boost precision. A recent foundational result relates a metrological advantage with negative quasiprobabilities -- quantum extensions of probabilities -- engendered by noncommuting operators. We crystallize the relationship in an equation that we prove theoretically and observe experimentally. Our proof-of-principle optical experiment features a filtering technique that we term partially postselected amplification (PPA). Using PPA, we measure a waveplate's birefringent phase. PPA amplifies, by over two orders of magnitude, the information obtained about the phase per detected photon. In principle, PPA can boost the information obtained from the average filtered photon by an arbitrarily large factor. The filter's amplification of systematic errors, we find, bounds the theoretically unlimited advantage in practice. PPA can facilitate any phase measurement and mitigates challenges that scale with trial number, such as proportional noise and detector saturation. By quantifying PPA's metrological advantage with quasiprobabilities, we reveal deep connections between quantum foundations and precision measurement.

We therefore present a systematic and extensive analysis of experience replay in Q-learning methods, focusing on two fundamental properties: the replay capacity and the ratio of learning updates to experience collected (replay ratio). Our additive and ablative studies upend conventional wisdom around experience replay -- greater capacity is found to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others unaffected. Counterintuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit for sifting through larger memory. Separately, by directly controlling the replay ratio we contextualize previous observations in the literature and empirically measure its importance across a variety of deep RL algorithms.

A larger window contains more samples and the frequency resolution can be higher for potentially better enhancement. This however incurs an algorithmic latency of 32 ms in an online setup, because the overlap-add algorithm used in the inverse STFT (iSTFT) is also performed based on the same 32 ms window size. To reduce this inherent latency, we adapt a conventional dual window size approach, where a regular input window size is used for STFT but a shorter output window is used for the overlap-add in the iSTFT, for STFT-domain deep learning based frame-online speech enhancement. Based on this STFT and iSTFT configuration, we employ single- or multi-microphone complex spectral mapping for frame-online enhancement, where a deep neural network (DNN) is trained to predict the real and imaginary (RI) components of target speech from the mixture RI components. In addition, we use the RI components predicted by the DNN to conduct frame-online beamforming, the results of which are then used as extra features for a second DNN to perform frame-online post-filtering. The frequency-domain beamforming in between the two DNNs can be easily integrated with complex spectral mapping and is designed to not incur any algorithmic latency. Additionally, we propose a future-frame prediction technique to further reduce the algorithmic latency. Evaluation results on a noisy-reverberant speech enhancement task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Compared with Conv-TasNet, our STFT-domain system can achieve better enhancement performance for a comparable amount of computation, or comparable performance with less computation, maintaining strong performance at an algorithmic latency as low as 2 ms.

We present the first detailed analysis of the astrophysical parameters of the poorly studied Sco-Cen member HD 152384 and its circumstellar environment. Methods. We analyze newly obtained optical-near-IR XSHOOTER spectra, as well as archival TESS data, of HD 152384. In addition, we use literature photometric data to construct a detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) of the star. Results. The photospheric absorption lines in the spectrum of HD 152384 are characteristic of a A0 V star, for which we derive a stellar mass of 2.1 +/- 0.1 M_sun and a stellar age > 4.5 Myr. Superimposed on the photospheric absorption, the optical spectrum also displays double-peaked emission lines of Ca II, Fe I, Mg I and Si I, typical of circumstellar disks. Notably, all Hydrogen and Helium lines appear strictly in absorption. A toy model shows that the observed emission line profiles can be reproduced by emission from a compact (radius < 0.3 au) disk seen at an inclination of ~24 degrees. Further evidence for the presence of circumstellar material comes from the detection of a moderate infrared excess in the SED, similar to those found in extreme debris disk systems. Conclusions. We conclude that HD 152384 is surrounded by a tenuous circumstellar disk which, although rich in refractory elements, is highly depleted of volatile elements. To the best of our knowledge such a disk is unique within the group of young stars. However, it is reminiscent of the disks seen in some white dwarfs, which have been attributed to the disruption of rocky planets. We suggest that the disk around HD 152384 may have a similar origin and may be due to collisions in a newly formed planetary system.

A key goal for health equity is to improve adoption of protective behaviors in this population. One promising strategy for intervention is to recruit peer leaders from the population of YEH to promote behaviors such as condom usage and regular HIV testing to their social contacts. This raises a computational question: which youth should be selected as peer leaders to maximize the overall impact of the intervention?

After HYPERs freeze-in, a dark sector phase transition decreases the mass of the mediator which connects HYPERs to the visible sector. This increases the HYPER's direct detection cross section, but in such a way as to leave the HYPER's abundance unaffected and avoid conflict with measurements of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background. HYPERs present a benchmark for direct detection experiments in a parameter space with few known dark matter models.

Our results demonstrate how repeated encounters between two dwarf galaxies can ""park"" baryons at very large distances, without the aid of environmental effects. Our best match to the data is an 8:1 mass ratio encounter where a one-armed spiral is induced in the NGC 4490-analog, which we postulate explains the nature of diffuse starlight presented in the new optical data. We predict that the pair will fully merge in ~370 Myr, but that the extended tidal features will continue to evolve and return to the merged remnant over ~5 Gyr. This pre-processing of baryons will affect the efficiency of gas stripping if such dwarf pairs are accreted by a massive host. In contrast, in isolated environments this study demonstrates how dwarf-dwarf interactions can create a long-lived supply of gas to the merger remnant.

However, representations of silicate weathering used in current estimates of the effective outer edge of the HZ do not account for the thermodynamic limit on concentration of weathering products in runoff set by clay precipitation, nor for the energetic limit on precipitation set by planetary instellation. We find that when the thermodynamic limit is included in an idealized coupled climate/weathering model, steady-state planetary climate loses sensitivity to silicate dissolution kinetics, becoming sensitive to temperature primarily through the effect of temperature on runoff and to pCO$_2$ through an effect on solute concentration mediated by pH. This increases sensitivity to land fraction, CO$_2$ outgassing, and geological factors such as soil age and lithology, all of which are found to have a profound effect on the position of the effective outer edge of the HZ. The interplay between runoff sensitivity and the energetic limit on precipitation leads to novel warm states in the outer reaches of the HZ, owing to the decoupling of temperature and precipitation.

The predicted absolute magnitude of the BH-NS kilonovae at $0.5\,{\rm days}$ after the merger falls in $[-10,-15.5]$. The simulated luminosity function contains the potential viewing-angle distribution information of the anisotropic kilonova emission. We simulate the GW detection rates, detectable distances and signal duration, for the future networks of 2nd/2.5th/3rd-generation GW detectors. BH-NSs tend to produce brighter kilonovae and afterglows if the BH has a higher aligned-spin, and a less massive NS with a stiffer EoS. The detectability of kilonova is especially sensitive to the BH spin. If BHs typically have low spins, the BH-NS EM counterparts are hard to discover. For the 2nd generation GW detector networks, a limiting magnitude of $m_{\rm limit}\sim23-24\,{\rm mag}$ is required to detect the kilonovae even if BH high spin is assumed. Thus, a plausible explanation for the lack of BH-NS associated kilonova detection during LIGO/Virgo O3 is that either there is no EM counterpart (plunging events), or the current follow-ups are too shallow. These observations still have the chance to detect the on-axis jet afterglow associated with an sGRB or an orphan afterglow. Follow-up observations can detect possible associated sGRB afterglows, from which kilonova signatures may be studied. For time-domain observations, a high-cadence search in redder filters is recommended to detect more BH-NS associated kilonovae and afterglows.

Specifically, we estimate the probability of the event that the property is violated under an input model. Our approach critically varies from the formal verification framework in that when the property can be violated, it provides an informative notion of how robust the network is, rather than just the conventional assertion that the network is not verifiable. Furthermore, it provides an ability to scale to larger networks than formal verification approaches. Though the framework still provides a formal guarantee of satisfiability whenever it successfully finds one or more violations, these advantages do come at the cost of only providing a statistical estimate of unsatisfiability whenever no violation is found. Key to the practical success of our approach is an adaptation of multi-level splitting, a Monte Carlo approach for estimating the probability of rare events, to our statistical robustness framework. We demonstrate that our approach is able to emulate formal verification procedures on benchmark problems, while scaling to larger networks and providing reliable additional information in the form of accurate estimates of the violation probability.

If set by radiative equilibrium with the central star, the temperature of dust in the disc plateaus at around $10-20$K in the outer regions. However sufficiently nearby massive stars can heat the outer disc to substantially higher temperatures. In this paper we study the radiative equilibrium temperature of discs in the presence of massive external sources and gauge the effect that it has on millimetre dust mass estimates. Since millimetre grains are not entrained in any wind we focus on geometrically simple 2D-axisymmetric disc models using radiative transfer calculations with both the host star and an external source. Recent surveys have searched for evidence of massive stars influencing disc evolution using disc properties as a function of projected separation. In assuming a disc temperature of $20$K for a disc a distance $D$ from a strong radiation source, disc masses are overestimated by a factor that scales with $D^{-1/2}$ interior to the separation that external heating becomes important. This could significantly alter dust mass estimates of discs in close proximity to $\theta^1$C in the Orion Nebular Cluster. We also make an initial assessment of the effect upon snow lines. Within a parsec of an O star like $\theta^1$C a CO snow line no longer exists, though the water snow line is virtually unaffected except for very close separations of $\leq0.01\,$pc.

A natural question is whether noise on NISQ devices places fundamental limitations on VQA performance. We rigorously prove a serious limitation for noisy VQAs, in that the noise causes the training landscape to have a barren plateau (i.e., vanishing gradient). Specifically, for the local Pauli noise considered, we prove that the gradient vanishes exponentially in the number of qubits $n$ if the depth of the ansatz grows linearly with $n$. These noise-induced barren plateaus (NIBPs) are conceptually different from noise-free barren plateaus, which are linked to random parameter initialization. Our result is formulated for a generic ansatz that includes as special cases the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz and the Unitary Coupled Cluster Ansatz, among others.

Current artificial language processing systems rely on the same domain general principles, embodied in artificial neural networks. Indeed, recent progress in this field depends on \emph{query-based attention}, which extends the ability of these systems to exploit context and has contributed to remarkable breakthroughs. Nevertheless, most current models focus exclusively on language-internal tasks, limiting their ability to perform tasks that depend on understanding situations. These systems also lack memory for the contents of prior situations outside of a fixed contextual span. We describe the organization of the brain's distributed understanding system, which includes a fast learning system that addresses the memory problem.

In addition, we estimate Stream C to lie at a distance between 794 and 862 kpc and Stream D between 758 kpc and 868 kpc. We estimate the median metallicity of Stream C to lie in the range -0.7 to -1.6 dex and a metallicity of -1.1^{+0.3}_{-0.2} dex for Stream D. RGB widths for the two structures are estimated to lie in the range 0.4 to 1.2 dex and 0.3 to 0.7 dex respectively. In total, measurements are obtained for 19 subfields along the Giant Stellar Stream, 4 along Stream C, 5 along Stream D and 3 general M31 spheroid fields for comparison.

Mid-circuit measurements have both classical and quantum outputs, so they can be subject to error modes that do not exist for measurements that terminate quantum circuits. Here we show how to characterize mid-circuit measurements, modelled by quantum instruments, using a technique that we call quantum instrument linear gate set tomography (QILGST). We then apply this technique to characterize a dispersive measurement on a superconducting transmon qubit within a multiqubit system. By varying the delay time between the measurement pulse and subsequent gates, we explore the impact of residual cavity photon population on measurement error. QILGST can resolve different error modes and quantify the total error from a measurement; in our experiment, for delay times above 1000 ns we measured a total error rate (i.e., half diamond distance) of $\epsilon_{\diamond} = 8.1 \pm 1.4 \%$, a readout fidelity of $97.0 \pm 0.3\%$, and output quantum state fidelities of $96.7 \pm 0.6\%$ and $93.7 \pm 0.7\%$ when measuring $0$ and $1$, respectively.

In this paper, we examine the ability of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to observe dust substructure in a young, planet-forming disc at cm wavelengths. We use dusty hydrodynamics and continuum radiative transfer to predict the distribution and emission of 1 cm dust grains (or pebbles) within the disc, and simulate continuum observations with the current SKA1-MID design baseline at frequencies of 12.5 GHz (Band 5b, ~2.4 cm) on 5-10 au scales. The SKA will provide high-fidelity observations of the cm dust emission substructure in discs for integration times totalling 100's of hours. Radial structure can be obtained at a sufficient resolution and S/N from shorter (10's of hours) integration times by azimuthal averaging in the image plane. By modelling the intensity distribution directly in the visibility plane, it is possible to recover a similar level of (axisymmetric) structural detail from observations with integration times 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than required for high-fidelity imaging.

In handwritten documents, novelty can be a change in writer, character attributes, writing attributes, or overall document appearance, among other things. Instead of looking at each aspect independently, we suggest that an integrated agent that can process known characters and novelties simultaneously is a better strategy.

The ongoing campaign started in May 2018, and we report here on $\sim1.5$ years of observations. The campaign, which consists of 105 observations, has a typical cadence of 3--6 days, and has the goal of determining the long-term X-ray variability of the ULXs. Two of the most variable sources were ULX7 and ULX8, both of which are known to be powered by neutron stars that are exceeding their isotropic Eddington luminosities by factors of up to 100. This is further evidence that neutron star powered ULXs are the most variable. Our two main results are, first, that ULX7 exhibits a periodic flux modulation with a period of 38 days varying over a magnitude and a half in flux from peak to trough. Since the orbital period of the system is known to be 2 days, the modulation is super-orbital, which is a near-ubiquitous property of ULX pulsars. Secondly we identify a new transient ULX, M51 XT-1, the onset of which occurred during our campaign, reaching a peak luminosity of $\sim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$, before gradually fading over the next $\sim200$ days until it slipped below the detection limit of our observations.

Such experiments motivate new attention to the theory of alpha particle confinement and transport. A key topic is the interaction of alphas with perturbations to the tokamak fields, including those from ripple and magnetohydrodynamic modes like Alfv\'{e}n eigenmodes. These perturbations can transport alphas, leading to changed localization of alpha heating, loss of alpha power, and damage to device walls. Alpha interaction with these perturbations is often studied with single particle theory. In contrast, we derive a drift kinetic theory to calculate the alpha heat flux resulting from arbitrary perturbation frequency and periodicity (provided these can be studied drift kinetically). Novel features of the theory include the retention of a large effective collision frequency resulting from the resonant alpha collisional boundary layer, correlated interactions over many poloidal transits, and finite orbit effects. Heat fluxes are considered for the example cases of ripple and the toroidal Alfv\'{e}n eigenmode (TAE). The ripple heat flux is small. The TAE heat flux is significant and scales with the square of the perturbation amplitude, allowing the derivation of constraints on mode amplitude for avoidance of significant alpha depletion. A simple saturation condition suggests that TAEs in one upcoming experiment will not cause significant alpha transport via the mechanisms in this theory. However, saturation above the level suggested by the simple condition, but within numerical and experimental experience, which could be accompanied by the onset of stochasticity, could cause significant transport.

Due to solar mass-loss -- which is expected to remove roughly half of the star's mass -- the orbits of the giant planets expand. This adiabatic process maintains the orbital period ratios, but the mutual interactions between planets and the width of mean-motion resonances (MMR) increase, leading to the capture of Jupiter and Saturn into a stable 5:2 resonant configuration. The expanded orbits, coupled with the large-amplitude librations of the critical MMR angle, make the system more susceptible to perturbations from stellar flyby interactions. Accordingly, within about 30 Gyr, stellar encounters perturb the planets onto the chaotic sub-domain of the 5:2 resonance, triggering a large-scale instability, which culminates in the ejections of all but one planet over the subsequent $\sim10$ Gyr. After an additional $\sim50$ Gyr, a close stellar encounter (with a perihelion distance less than $\sim200$ AU) liberates the final planet. Through this sequence of events, the characteristic timescale over which the solar system will be completely dissolved is roughly 100 Gyr.

In the standard CP paradigm, the predicted set can often be unusably large and also costly to obtain.

We first expand the CP correctness criterion to allow for additional, inferred ""admissible"" answers, which can substantially reduce the size of the predicted set while still providing valid performance guarantees. Second, we amortize costs by conformalizing prediction cascades, in which we aggressively prune implausible labels early on by using progressively stronger classifiers -- again, while still providing valid performance guarantees.

The adjoint variable method, which allows for the efficient computation of gradients, has played a major role in this success. However, gradient-based optimization has not yet been applied to the mode-expansion methods that are the most common approach to studying periodic optical structures like photonic crystals. This is because, in such simulations, the adjoint variable method cannot be defined as explicitly as in standard finite-difference or finite-element time- or frequency-domain methods. Here, we overcome this through the use of automatic differentiation, which is a generalization of the adjoint variable method to arbitrary computational graphs. We implement the plane-wave expansion and the guided-mode expansion methods using an automatic differentiation library, and show that the gradient of any simulation output can be computed efficiently and in parallel with respect to all input parameters. We then use this implementation to optimize the dispersion of a photonic crystal waveguide, and the quality factor of an ultra-small cavity in a lithium niobate slab. This extends photonic inverse design to a whole new class of simulations, and more broadly highlights the importance that automatic differentiation could play in the future for tracking and optimizing complicated physical models.

While there has been an expansive literature which has discussed the occurrence of Type I-IV in many non-standard cosmologies, w-singularities have not yet been explored in exotic cosmological settings. So in this work we pursue the same and discuss the status quo of w-singularities in a variety of non-standard cosmologies.

We also consider cosmologies due to modified area-entropy relations, generalized uncertainty principles, holographic renormalization and Chern-Simons gravity( all of which can be coincidentally described by the same form of the modified Friedmann equation). We show that w-singularities will occur in exactly the same conditions in all these vividly different cosmological settings as they do in the usual general relativistic cosmology if one considers a power series expansion ansatz for the scale factor.

Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now providing results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of confirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the same dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in ~1-3 Myr old star-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates of their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and multiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low mass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower than the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses are comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found also by converting the measured planet masses into heavy-element content (core masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly (<0.1-1 Myr) and large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or that disks are continuously replenished of fresh planet-forming material from the environment.

Firstly, we derive the covariance functions of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with exponential linear units (ELU) and Gaussian error linear units (GELU) and evaluate the performance of the limiting Gaussian processes on some benchmarks. Secondly, and more generally, we analyse the fixed-point dynamics of iterated kernels corresponding to a broad range of activation functions.

We find no evidence of variability between the Chandra and NuSTAR observations (separated by 2 years), and between the two NuSTAR observations (separated by 10 months). Using self-consistent X-ray models, we rule out the scenario where the obscuring medium is nearly spherical and uniform, contradicting the results implied by the $<$10 keV Chandra spectrum. The line-of-sight column density, from intervening matter between the source and observer that intercepts the intrinsic AGN X-ray emission, is well within the Compton-thick regime, with a minimum column density of $2\times10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. The average global column density is high ($> 3\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$), with both Compton-thick and Compton-thin solutions permitted depending on the X-ray spectral model.

Here, we present a new Bayesian framework that allows inference of these properties, while taking into account the systematic modeling uncertainties that arise when mapping from GW binary progenitor properties to photometric light curves. We extend the relative binning method presented in Zackay et al. (2018) to include extrinsic GW parameters for fast analysis of the GW signal.

Exchanging information is crucial for many real systems: the internet, transportation networks and the brain are key examples. Despite the introduction of measures of efficiency to analyze network flows, i.e. topologies characterized by weighted connectivity, here we show that they fail to capture combined information of link existence and link weight. In this letter we propose a physically-grounded estimator of flow efficiency which can be computed for every weighted network, regardless from the scale and nature of weights and from any (missing) metadata. Remarkably, results show that our estimator captures the heterogeneity of flows along with topological differences and its complement information obtained from percolation analysis of several empirical systems, including transportation, trade, migrations, and brain networks. We show that cutting the heaviest connections may increase the average communication efficiency of the system and hence, counterintuively, a sparser network is not necessarily less efficient.

The lower value of the optical depth disfavours an early onset and an early completion of reionization in favour of a redsfhit range where different astrophysical probes provide sensible information on the sources of reionization and the status of the intergalactic medium. In this work we extend our previous study in which we constrained reionization by combining three different probes - CMB, UV luminosity density and neutral hydrogen fraction data - in both treatment and data: we first allow variation in the UV source term varying the product of the efficiency of conversion of UV luminosity into ionizing photons and the escape fraction together with the reionization and cosmological parameters, and then we investigate the impact of a less conservative cut for the UV luminosity function. We find that the estimate for the efficiency is consistent within 95% C.L. with the fixed value we considered in our previous results and is mostly constrained by the QHII data. We find that allowing the efficiency to vary does not affect significantly our results for the average optical depth for monotonic reionization histories, recovering $\tau=0.0519_{-0.0008}^{+0.0010}$ at 68% CL , consistent with our previous studies. Using a less conservative cut for the UV luminosity function, we find $\tau=0.0541_{-0.0016}^{+0.0013}$ at 68% CL, due to the faint end of the luminosity function in the data we use, that also prefers a larger contribution from higher redshifts.

Learning a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant information and exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle, optimal exploration and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply maximizing task performance. However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with local optima due to a chicken-and-egg problem: learning to explore requires good exploitation to gauge the exploration's utility, but learning to exploit requires information gathered via exploration. Optimizing separate objectives for exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem, but prior meta-RL exploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information irrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an exploitation objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information and an exploration objective to recover only this information. This avoids local optima in end-to-end training, without sacrificing optimal exploration.

This approach is motivated, for example, from a quantum gravity perspective, among others. Noncommutative gravity has been tested against the binary black hole merger event GW150914. Here, we extend and improve upon such a previous analysis by (i) relaxing an assumption made on the preferred direction due to noncommutativity, (ii) using posterior samples produced by the LIGO/Virgo Collaborations, (iii) consider other gravitational wave events, namely GW151226, GW170608, GW170814 and GW170817, and (iv) consider binary pulsar observations. Using Kepler's law that contains the noncommutative effect at second post-Newtonian order, we derive corrections to the gravitational waveform phase and the pericenter precession. Using the gravitational wave and double pulsar binary observations, we find bounds on a space-time noncommutative tensor $\theta^{0i}$ in terms of the preferred frame direction with respect to the orientation of each binary. We find that the gravitational wave bounds are stronger than the binary pulsar one by an order of magnitude and the noncommutative tensor normalized by the Planck length and time is constrained to be of order unity.

In these models, a large-sized rotationally-supported disk forms and a weak outflow appears, in contrast to a smaller disk and strong outflow in the aligned case ($\theta_0 = 0$).

By using an iterative approach, dielectric nanostructures can be designed to effectively remove the destructive terms. In this way dielectric Mie resonators, featuring low LDOS for electric dipoles, can be reshaped to enable enhancements of three orders of magnitude. To demonstrate the generality of the method, we also design nanocavities that enhance the radiated power of a circular dipole, a quadrupole and an arbitrary collection of coherent dipoles.

Whilst gas-phase metallicty gradients are generally weak in our simulated galaxies, we find that stellar metallicity gradients are common, with central regions tending to be more metal-rich than the outer parts. The strength of the gradient is correlated with galaxy-wide median stellar age, such that galaxies with younger stellar populations have flatter gradients. Stellar metallicty gradients are set by two competing processes: (1) the steady ""puffing"" of old, metal-poor stars by feedback-driven potential fluctuations, and (2) the accretion of extended, metal-rich gas at late times, which fuels late-time metal-rich star formation. If recent star formation dominates, then extended, metal-rich star formation washes out pre-existing gradients from the ""puffing"" process. We use published results from ten Local Group dwarf galaxies to show that a similar relationship between age and stellar metallicity-gradient strength exists among real dwarfs. This suggests that observed stellar metallicity gradients may be driven largely by the baryon/feedback cycle rather than by external environmental effects.

For nine further galaxies, we detect a singly-imaged but closely-projected source within 6 arcsec (including one candidate with sources at three different redshifts); such cases can be exploited to derive upper limits on the IMF mass-excess factor, $\alpha$. Combining the new lens and new upper limits, with the previously-discovered systems, we infer an average $\langle \alpha \rangle$ = 1.06 $\pm$ 0.08 (marginalised over the intrinsic scatter), which is inconsistent with a Salpeter-like IMF ($\alpha$ = 1.55) at the 6$\sigma$ level.

Regardless of whether they were stripped by a binary companion or managed to peel off their outer layers by themselves, the influence and final fate of helium stars -- in particular the resulting black hole mass -- highly depends on their wind mass loss as stripped-envelope objects. While empirical mass-loss constraints for massive helium stars have improved over the last decades, the resulting recipes are limited to metallicities with the observational ability to sufficiently resolve individual stars. Yet, theoretical efforts have been hampered by the complexity of Wolf-Rayet (WR) winds arising from the more massive helium stars. In an unprecedented effort, we calculate next-generation stellar atmosphere models resembling massive helium main sequence stars with Fe-bump driven winds up to $500\,M_\odot$ over a wide metallicity range between $2.0$ and $0.02\,Z_\odot$. We uncover a complex $\Gamma_\text{e}$-dependency of WR-type winds and their metallicity-dependent breakdown. The latter can be related to the onset of multiple scattering, requiring higher $L/M$-ratios at lower metallicity. Based on our findings, we derive the first ever theoretically-motivated mass-loss recipe for massive helium stars. We also provide estimates for LyC and He II ionizing fluxes, finding stripped helium stars to contribute considerably at low metallicity. In sharp contrast to OB-star winds, the mass loss for helium stars scales with the terminal velocity. While limited to the helium main sequence, our study marks a major step towards a better theoretical understanding of helium star evolution.

In this way, we aim to help BERT not to forget assigning importance to informative input tokens when making predictions by proposing SaLoss; an auxiliary loss function for guiding the multi-head attention mechanism during training to be close to salient information extracted a priori using TextRank. Experiments for explanation faithfulness across five datasets, show that models trained with SaLoss consistently provide more faithful explanations across four different feature attribution methods compared to vanilla BERT. Using the rationales extracted from vanilla BERT and SaLoss models to train inherently faithful classifiers, we further show that the latter result in higher predictive performance in downstream tasks.

Our focus is on lexical (e.g., swear words, slurs, identity mentions) and dialectal markers (specifically African American English). Our comprehensive experiments establish that existing methods are limited in their ability to prevent biased behavior in current toxicity detectors. We then propose an automatic, dialect-aware data correction method, as a proof-of-concept. Despite the use of synthetic labels, this method reduces dialectal associations with toxicity.

The Derived Motion Winds (DMW) Algorithm is commonly used to process these data and estimate atmospheric winds by tracking features in images taken by the GOES-R series of the NOAA geostationary meteorological satellites. However, the wind estimates from the DMW Algorithm are sparse and do not come with uncertainty measures. This motivates us to statistically model wind motions as a spatial process drifting in time. We propose a covariance function that depends on spatial and temporal lags and a drift parameter to capture the wind speed and wind direction. We estimate the parameters by local maximum likelihood. Our method allows us to compute standard errors of the estimates, enabling spatial smoothing of the estimates using a Gaussian kernel weighted by the inverses of the estimated variances. We conduct extensive simulation studies to determine the situations where our method performs well. The proposed method is applied to the GOES-15 brightness temperature data over Colorado and reduces prediction error of brightness temperature compared to the DMW Algorithm.

We present a comprehensive investigation of this relationship for a sample of 286 well-resolved radio galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Deep Fields (LoTSS-Deep) first data release, for which robust morphological and accretion mode classifications have been made. We find that two-thirds of luminous FRII radio galaxies are RI, and identify no significant differences in the visual appearance or source dynamic range (peak/mean surface brightness) of the RI and RE FRIIs, demonstrating that both RI and RE systems can produce FRII structures. We also find a significant population of low-luminosity FRIIs (predominantly RI), supporting our earlier conclusion that FRII radio structures can be produced at all radio luminosities. We demonstrate that in the luminosity range where both morphologies are present, the probability of producing FRI or FRII radio morphology is directly linked to stellar mass, while across all morphologies and luminosities, RE accretion occurs in systems with high specific star formation rate, presumably because this traces fuel availability.

Our solution is QMIX, a novel value-based method that can train decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end fashion. QMIX employs a network that estimates joint action-values as a complex non-linear combination of per-agent values that condition only on local observations. We structurally enforce that the joint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, which allows tractable maximisation of the joint action-value in off-policy learning, and guarantees consistency between the centralised and decentralised policies.

To address this, we leverage parametric modular structure to learn component-level surrogates, enabling cheaper high-fidelity simulation.

Previous work revealed the importance of the minimum eigenvalue of the OEC matrix for conditioning and convergence of the unpreconditioned data assimilation problem. In this paper we examine the use of correlated OEC matrices in the preconditioned data assimilation problem for the first time. We consider the case where there are more state variables than observations, which is typical for applications with sparse measurements e.g. NWP and remote sensing. We find that similarly to the unpreconditioned problem, the minimum eigenvalue of the OEC matrix appears in new bounds on the condition number of the Hessian of the preconditioned objective function. Numerical experiments reveal that the condition number of the Hessian is minimised when the background and observation lengthscales are equal. This contrasts with the unpreconditioned case, where decreasing the observation error lengthscale always improves conditioning. Conjugate gradient experiments show that in this framework the condition number of the Hessian is a good proxy for convergence.

Despite their performance, they still suffer from interference across tasks which leads to catastrophic forgetting. To ameliorate this problem, we propose to only activate and select sparse neurons for learning current and past tasks at any stage. More parameters space and model capacity can thus be reserved for the future tasks. This minimizes the interference between parameters for different tasks. To do so, we propose a Sparse neural Network for Continual Learning (SNCL), which employs variational Bayesian sparsity priors on the activations of the neurons in all layers. Full Experience Replay (FER) provides effective supervision in learning the sparse activations of the neurons in different layers. A loss-aware reservoir-sampling strategy is developed to maintain the memory buffer. The proposed method is agnostic as to the network structures and the task boundaries.

In this paper, we propose Pareto efficient Fairness (PEF) as a suitable fairness notion for supervised learning, that can ensure the optimal trade-off between overall loss and other fairness criteria. The proposed PEF notion is definition-agnostic, meaning that any well-defined notion of fairness can be reduced to the PEF notion. To efficiently find a PEF classifier, we cast the fairness-enhanced classification as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a gradient-based method that can guarantee the solution belongs to the Pareto frontier with provable guarantees for convex and non-convex objectives. We also generalize the proposed algorithmic solution to extract and trace arbitrary solutions from the Pareto frontier for a given preference over accuracy and fairness measures. This approach is generic and can be generalized to any multicriteria optimization problem to trace points on the Pareto frontier curve, which is interesting by its own right.

We emulate and extend the NANOGrav dataset, injecting a wide range of stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) signals that encompass a variety of amplitudes and spectral shapes, and quantify three key milestones: (I) Given the amplitude measured in the 12.5 yr analysis and assuming this signal is a GWB, we expect to accumulate robust evidence of an interpulsar-correlated GWB signal with 15--17 yrs of data, i.e., an additional 2--5 yrs from the 12.5 yr dataset; (II) At the initial detection, we expect a fractional uncertainty of $40\%$ on the power-law strain spectrum slope, which is sufficient to distinguish a GWB of supermassive black-hole binary origin from some models predicting more exotic origins;(III) Similarly, the measured GWB amplitude will have an uncertainty of $44\%$ upon initial detection, allowing us to arbitrate between some population models of supermassive black-hole binaries. In addition, power-law models are distinguishable from those having low-frequency spectral turnovers once 20~yrs of data are reached. Even though our study is based on the NANOGrav data, we also derive relations that allow for a generalization to other pulsar-timing array datasets.

The MiniBooNE data are consistent in energy and magnitude with the excess of events reported by the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND), and the significance of the combined LSND and MiniBooNE excesses is $6.0 \sigma$. A two-neutrino oscillation interpretation of the data would require at least four neutrino types and indicate physics beyond the three neutrino paradigm.Although the data are fit with a two-neutrino oscillation model, other models may provide better fits to the data.

Despite more than a decade of research and development, the problem of how to competently interact with diverse road users in diverse scenarios remains largely unsolved. Learning methods have much to offer towards solving this problem. But they require a realistic multi-agent simulator that generates diverse and competent driving interactions. To meet this need, we develop a dedicated simulation platform called SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent RL Training School). SMARTS supports the training, accumulation, and use of diverse behavior models of road users. These are in turn used to create increasingly more realistic and diverse interactions that enable deeper and broader research on multi-agent interaction. In this paper, we describe the design goals of SMARTS, explain its basic architecture and its key features, and illustrate its use through concrete multi-agent experiments on interactive scenarios.

We present the first detailed analysis of the astrophysical parameters of the poorly studied Sco-Cen member HD 152384 and its circumstellar environment. Methods. We analyze newly obtained optical-near-IR XSHOOTER spectra, as well as archival TESS data, of HD 152384. In addition, we use literature photometric data to construct a detailed spectral energy distribution (SED) of the star. Results. The photospheric absorption lines in the spectrum of HD 152384 are characteristic of a A0 V star, for which we derive a stellar mass of 2.1 +/- 0.1 M_sun and a stellar age > 4.5 Myr. Superimposed on the photospheric absorption, the optical spectrum also displays double-peaked emission lines of Ca II, Fe I, Mg I and Si I, typical of circumstellar disks. Notably, all Hydrogen and Helium lines appear strictly in absorption. A toy model shows that the observed emission line profiles can be reproduced by emission from a compact (radius < 0.3 au) disk seen at an inclination of ~24 degrees. Further evidence for the presence of circumstellar material comes from the detection of a moderate infrared excess in the SED, similar to those found in extreme debris disk systems. Conclusions. We conclude that HD 152384 is surrounded by a tenuous circumstellar disk which, although rich in refractory elements, is highly depleted of volatile elements. To the best of our knowledge such a disk is unique within the group of young stars. However, it is reminiscent of the disks seen in some white dwarfs, which have been attributed to the disruption of rocky planets. We suggest that the disk around HD 152384 may have a similar origin and may be due to collisions in a newly formed planetary system.

We select targets below the main sequence in the Gaia color-magnitude diagram with ZTF light curves showing large-amplitude ellipsoidal variability and orbital period $P_{\rm orb} < 6$ hr. This yields 51 candidates brighter than G=18, of which we have obtained many-epoch spectra for 21. We confirm all 21 to be completely -- or nearly -- Roche lobe filling close binaries. 13 show evidence of ongoing mass transfer, which has likely just ceased in the other 8. Most of the secondaries are hotter than any previously known CV donors, with temperatures $4700<T_{{\rm eff}}/{\rm K}<8000$. Remarkably, all secondaries with $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 7000\,\rm K$ appear to be detached, while all cooler secondaries are still mass-transferring. This transition likely marks the temperature where magnetic braking becomes inefficient due to loss of the donor's convective envelope. Most of the proto-WD secondaries have masses near $0.15\,M_{\odot}$; their companions have masses near $0.8\,M_{\odot}$. We infer a space density of $\sim 60\,\rm kpc^{-3}$, roughly 80 times lower than that of normal CVs and three times lower than that of ELM WDs. The implied Galactic birth rate, $\mathcal{R}\sim 60\,\rm Myr^{-1}$, is half that of AM CVn binaries. Most systems are well-described by MESA models for CVs in which mass transfer begins only as the donor leaves the main sequence. All are predicted to reach minimum periods $5\lesssim P_{\rm orb}/{\rm min}\lesssim30$ within a Hubble time, where they will become AM CVn binaries or merge.

In this paper we explore the use of deep generative models to simultaneously correct and downscale (super-resolve) global ensemble forecasts over the Continental US. Specifically, using fine-grained radar observations as our ground truth, we train a conditional Generative Adversarial Network -- coined CorrectorGAN -- via a custom training procedure and augmented loss function, to produce ensembles of high-resolution, bias-corrected forecasts based on coarse, global precipitation forecasts in addition to other relevant meteorological fields. Our model outperforms an interpolation baseline, as well as super-resolution-only and CNN-based univariate methods, and approaches the performance of an operational regional high-resolution model across an array of established probabilistic metrics. Crucially, CorrectorGAN, once trained, produces predictions in seconds on a single machine. These results raise exciting questions about the necessity of regional models, and whether data-driven downscaling and correction methods can be transferred to data-poor regions that so far have had no access to high-resolution forecasts.

We give a polynomial-time algorithm for finding the optimal target-set to optimize the sum of opinions when there are no budget constraints on the size of the target-set. We show that this problem is NP-hard when there is a budget, and that the objective function is neither submodular nor supermodular.

Method: We trained a deep learning network to automatically segment the CRVT&B from the B-scans of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) volume of the optic nerve head (ONH). Subsequently, two different approaches were used for glaucoma diagnosis using the structural configuration of the CRVT&B as extracted from the OCT volumes. In the first approach, we aimed to provide a diagnosis using only 3D CNN and the 3D structure of the CRVT&B. For the second approach, we projected the 3D structure of the CRVT&B orthographically onto three planes to obtain 2D images, and then a 2D CNN was used for diagnosis. The segmentation accuracy was evaluated using the Dice coefficient, whereas the diagnostic accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). The diagnostic performance of the CRVT&B was also compared with that of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Results: Our segmentation network was able to efficiently segment retinal blood vessels from OCT scans. On a test set, we achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.81\pm0.07. The 3D and 2D diagnostic networks were able to differentiate glaucoma from non-glaucoma subjects with accuracies of 82.7% and 83.3%, respectively. The corresponding AUCs for CRVT&B were 0.89 and 0.90, higher than those obtained with RNFL thickness alone. Conclusions: Our work demonstrated that the diagnostic power of the CRVT&B is superior to that of a gold-standard glaucoma parameter, i.e., RNFL thickness. Our work also suggested that the major retinal blood vessels form a skeleton -- the configuration of which may be representative of major ONH structural changes as typically observed with the development and progression of glaucoma.

Historically, analyzing the causal structure of DNNs has received less attention than understanding their responses to input. Yet definitionally, generalizability must be a function of a DNN's causal structure since it reflects how the DNN responds to unseen or even not-yet-defined future inputs. Here, we introduce a suite of metrics based on information theory to quantify and track changes in the causal structure of DNNs during training. Specifically, we introduce the effective information (EI) of a feedforward DNN, which is the mutual information between layer input and output following a maximum-entropy perturbation. The EI can be used to assess the degree of causal influence nodes and edges have over their downstream targets in each layer. We show that the EI can be further decomposed in order to examine the sensitivity of a layer (measured by how well edges transmit perturbations) and the degeneracy of a layer (measured by how edge overlap interferes with transmission), along with estimates of the amount of integrated information of a layer. Together, these properties define where each layer lies in the ""causal plane"" which can be used to visualize how layer connectivity becomes more sensitive or degenerate over time, and how integration changes during training, revealing how the layer-by-layer causal structure differentiates.

This improves only marginally if we consider whether galaxies have undergone a merger within the last Gyr. When also considering minor mergers, galaxies display no trend of moving towards the merger regime with increasing merger ratio. From z = 4 -> 2, galaxies move from the non-merger towards the merger regime in all statistics, but this is primarily an effect of mass: Above a given noise level, higher mass galaxies display a more complex outer morphology induced by their clustered environment.

Each layer is also augmented with latent random variables, which are sampled from a prior distribution during the training of that layer. The maximum entropy objective causes these latent variables to be incorporated into the layer's policy, and the higher level layer can directly control the behavior of the lower layer through this latent space. Furthermore, by constraining the mapping from latent variables to actions to be invertible, higher layers retain full expressivity: neither the higher layers nor the lower layers are constrained in their behavior. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that we can improve on the performance of single-layer policies on standard benchmark tasks simply by adding additional layers, and that our method can solve more complex sparse-reward tasks by learning higher-level policies on top of high-entropy skills optimized for simple low-level objectives.

First, a novel expansion many-body method applicable to superfluid open-shell nuclei, the so-called Bogoliubov in-medium similarity renormalization group (BIMSRG) theory, is formulated. This generalization of standard single-reference IMSRG theory for closed-shell systems parallels the recent extensions of coupled cluster, self-consistent Green's function or many-body perturbation theory. Within the realm of IMSRG theories, BIMSRG provides an interesting alternative to the already existing multi-reference IMSRG (MR-IMSRG) method applicable to open-shell nuclei. The algebraic equations for low-order approximations, i.e., BIMSRG(1) and BIMSRG(2), can be derived manually without much difficulty. However, such a methodology becomes already impractical and error prone for the derivation of the BIMSRG(3) equations, which are eventually needed to reach high accuracy. Based on a diagrammatic formulation of BIMSRG theory, the second objective of the present paper is thus to describe the third version (v3.0.0) of the ADG code that automatically (1) generates all valid BIMSRG(n) diagrams and (2) evaluates their algebraic expressions in a matter of seconds. This is achieved in such a way that equations can easily be retrieved for both the flow equation and the Magnus expansion formulations of BIMSRG. Expanding on this work, the first future objective is to numerically implement BIMSRG(2) (eventually BIMSRG(3)) equations and perform ab initio calculations of mid-mass open-shell nuclei.

Paper and code to follow soon! <LINK>",https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07871,"Recently, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have offered a powerful new paradigm for solving problems relating to differential equations. Compared to classical numerical methods PINNs have several advantages, for example their ability to provide mesh-free solutions of differential equations and their ability to carry out forward and inverse modelling within the same optimisation problem. Whilst promising, a key limitation to date is that PINNs have struggled to accurately and efficiently solve problems with large domains and/or multi-scale solutions, which is crucial for their real-world application. Multiple significant and related factors contribute to this issue, including the increasing complexity of the underlying PINN optimisation problem as the problem size grows and the spectral bias of neural networks. In this work we propose a new, scalable approach for solving large problems relating to differential equations called Finite Basis PINNs (FBPINNs). FBPINNs are inspired by classical finite element methods, where the solution of the differential equation is expressed as the sum of a finite set of basis functions with compact support. In FBPINNs neural networks are used to learn these basis functions, which are defined over small, overlapping subdomains. FBINNs are designed to address the spectral bias of neural networks by using separate input normalisation over each subdomain, and reduce the complexity of the underlying optimisation problem by using many smaller neural networks in a parallel divide-and-conquer approach. Our numerical experiments show that FBPINNs are effective in solving both small and larger, multi-scale problems, outperforming standard PINNs in both accuracy and computational resources required, potentially paving the way to the application of PINNs on large, real-world problems.

In theories beyond you can. We look at this in effective field theory and find that with heavy new physics at the TeV scale it can be possible given existing constraints on parameters Why do we want such an abrupt (also called strongly first-order) phase transition? Two reasons: Reason 1. Because then you might be able to explain why there aren't equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the universe. This is called electroweak baryogenesis and requires something very cool called sphalerons. Which you can't have if the transition is too weak.

A first-order EWPT has previously been shown to be possible in the SMEFT. Phenomenology studies have focused on scenarios with a tree-level barrier between minima, which requires a negative Higgs quartic coupling and a new physics scale low enough to raise questions about the validity of the EFT approach. In this work we stress that a first-order EWPT is also possible when the barrier between minima is generated radiatively, the quartic coupling is positive, the scale of new physics is higher, and there is good agreement with experimental bounds. Our calculation is done in a consistent, gauge-invariant way, and we carefully analyze the scaling of parameters necessary to generate a barrier in the potential. We perform a global fit in the relevant parameter space and explicitly find the points with a first-order transition that agree with experimental data.

Deep Ensembles are widely considered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty estimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another popular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first uses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the second relies on a finite number of independent models. To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal configuration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to implement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the cost. We experimentally validate Masksembles on two widely used datasets, CIFAR10 and ImageNet. ",Masksembles for Uncertainty Estimation,1,['Measuring the uncertainty of deep net results is a challenge.

A more sophisticated stochastic strategy, one-hop targeting, is to select random network neighbors of random individuals; this exploits a version of the friendship paradox, whereby the friend of a random individual is expected to have more friends than a random individual, with the hope that seeding a behavior at more connected individuals leads to more adoption.

In the modern era of asteroseismology, parameters of solar-like stars are derived by fitting theoretical models to observational data, which include measurements of their oscillation frequencies, metallicity [Fe/H], and effective temperature Teff. Combining this information with transit data furthermore yields the corresponding parameters for their exoplanets. While [Fe/H] and Teff are commonly stated to a precision of ~0.1 dex and ~100 K, the impact of errors in their measurement has not been studied in practice within the context of the parameters derived from them. Here we use the Stellar Parameters in an Instant (SPI) pipeline to estimate the parameters of nearly 100 stars observed by Kepler and Gaia, many of which are confirmed planet hosts. We adjust the reported spectroscopic measurements of these stars by introducing faux systematic errors and artificially increasing the reported uncertainties, and quantify the differences in the resulting parameters. We find that a systematic error of 0.1 dex in [Fe/H] translates to differences of only 4%, 2%, and 1% on average in the resulting stellar ages, masses, and radii, which are well within their uncertainties (~11%, 3.5%, 1.4%) as derived by SPI. We also find that increasing the uncertainty of [Fe/H] measurements by 0.1 dex increases the uncertainties by only 0.01 Gyr, 0.02 M_sun, and 0.01 R_sun, which are again well below their reported uncertainties (0.5 Gyr, 0.04 M_sun, 0.02 R_sun).

Stellar parameters from SPI are unchanged within uncertainties by errors of up to 0.14 dex or 175 K, and are even more robust to errors in Teff than the seismic scaling relations.

Surrogate models of NR waveforms have been shown to be both fast and accurate. However, NR-based surrogate models are limited by the training waveforms' length, which is typically about 20 orbits before merger. We remedy this by hybridizing the NR waveforms using both post-Newtonian and effective one body waveforms for the early inspiral. We present NRHybSur3dq8, a surrogate model for hybridized nonprecessing numerical relativity waveforms, that is valid for the entire LIGO band (starting at $20~\text{Hz}$) for stellar mass binaries with total masses as low as $2.25\,M_{\odot}$. We include the $\ell \leq 4$ and $(5,5)$ spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes but not the $(4,1)$ or $(4,0)$ modes. This model has been trained against hybridized waveforms based on 104 NR waveforms with mass ratios $q\leq8$, and $|\chi_{1z}|,|\chi_{2z}| \leq 0.8$, where $\chi_{1z}$ ($\chi_{2z}$) is the spin of the heavier (lighter) BH in the direction of orbital angular momentum. The surrogate reproduces the hybrid waveforms accurately, with mismatches $\lesssim 3\times10^{-4}$ over the mass range $2.25M_{\odot} \leq M \leq 300 M_{\odot}$. At high masses ($M\gtrsim40M_{\odot}$), where the merger and ringdown are more prominent, we show roughly two orders of magnitude improvement over existing waveform models. We also show that the surrogate works well even when extrapolated outside its training parameter space range, including at spins as large as 0.998.

This dichotomy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years. In this work, we posit that the abstraction of natural language as a communication channel (\`a la Shannon, 1948) can provide new insights into the behaviors of probabilistic language generators, e.g., why high-probability texts can be dull or repetitive. Humans use language as a means of communicating information, and do so in a simultaneously efficient and error-minimizing manner; they choose each word in a string with this (perhaps subconscious) goal in mind. We propose that generation from probabilistic models should mimic this behavior. Rather than always choosing words from the high-probability region of the distribution--which have a low Shannon information content--we sample from the set of words with information content close to the conditional entropy of our model, i.e., close to the expected information content. This decision criterion can be realized through a simple and efficient implementation, which we call typical sampling. Automatic and human evaluations show that, in comparison to nucleus and top-k sampling, typical sampling offers competitive performance in terms of quality while consistently reducing the number of degenerate repetitions.

Here we focus on studying a generalization of the weighted social network model, being one of the most fundamental agent-based models for describing the formation of social ties and social networks. This Generalized Weighted Social Network (GWSN) model incorporates triadic closure, homophilic interactions, and various link termination mechanisms, which have been studied separately in the previous works. Accordingly, the GWSN model has an increased number of input parameters and the model behavior gets excessively complex, making it challenging to clarify the model behavior. We have executed massive simulations with a supercomputer and using the results as the training data for deep neural networks to conduct regression analysis for predicting the properties of the generated networks from the input parameters.

With albeit a lower sensitivity, it would allow early investigation of the nature and event rate of intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers, constraining our understanding of the universe formation by probing the building up of IMBH up to supermassive black holes. Technically, the CubeSats would create a triangular Sagnac interferometer with 140.000km roundtrip arm length, optimized to be sensitive to gravitational waves at frequencies between 10mHz and 2Hz. The nature of the Sagnac measurement makes it almost insensitive to position error, enabling the use of spacecrafts in ballistic trajectories.

A peak sensitivity of 23 pm/sqrt(Hz) is expected at 1Hz assuming a 200mW internal laser source and 10-centimeter diameter apertures.

We present a follow-up spectroscopic study of this stream based on data taken with the MEGARA instrument at the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias using the integral field spectroscopy mode. Although our data suggest that this compact object in the stream is actually a foreground Milky Way halo star, we detect emission lines overlapping a less compact, bluer and fainter blob of the stream that is clearly visible in both ultra-violet and optical deep images. From its heliocentric systemic radial velocity derived from the [OIII] 5007A lines (V_syst= 1548.58+/-1.80 km\s^-1) and new UV and optical broad-band photometry, we conclude that this over-density could be the actual core of the stream, with an absolute magnitude of Mg~ -10 and a g-r = 0.08+/- 0.11, consistent with a remnant of a low-mass dwarf satellite undergoing a current episode of star formation. From the width of the stream, we calculate that the progenitor mass is between 6.4 x 10^6 Mo -2.7 x 10^7 Mo, which is typical of a dwarf galaxy. These estimates suggest that this is one of the lowest mass streams detected so far beyond the Local Group. We find that blue stellar streams containing star formation regions are commonly predicted by high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxies lighter than the Milky Way. This scenario is consistent with the processes explaining the bursty star formation history of some dwarf satellites, which are followed by a gas depletion and a fast quenching once they enter within the virial radius of their host galaxies. Thus, it is likely that the stream's progenitor is suffering a star-formation burst comparable to those that have shaped the star-formation history of several Local Group dwarfs in the last few Gigayears.

In this paper, we articulate four such roles, through an analysis that considers the opportunities as well as the significant risks inherent in such work. Computing research can serve as a diagnostic, helping us to understand and measure social problems with precision and clarity. As a formalizer, computing shapes how social problems are explicitly defined --- changing how those problems, and possible responses to them, are understood. Computing serves as rebuttal when it illuminates the boundaries of what is possible through technical means. And computing acts as synecdoche when it makes long-standing social problems newly salient in the public eye. We offer these paths forward as modalities that leverage the particular strengths of computational work in the service of social change, without overclaiming computing's capacity to solve social problems on its own.

We first conducted a series of in-person interviews with well-respected reviewers in the software engineering field. Then, we used the results of those interviews to develop a questionnaire used in an online survey and sent out to reviewers from well-respected venues covering a number of software engineering disciplines, some of whom had won awards for their reviewing efforts. We analyzed the responses from the interviews and from 175 reviewers who completed the online survey (including both reviewers who had won awards and those who had not). We report on several descriptive results, including: 45% of award-winners are reviewing 20+ conference papers a year, while 28% of non-award winners conduct that many. 88% of reviewers are taking more than two hours on journal reviews. We also report on qualitative results. To write a good review, the important criteria were it should be factual and helpful, ranked above others such as being detailed or kind. The most important features of papers that result in positive reviews are clear and supported validation, an interesting problem, and novelty. Conversely, negative reviews tend to result from papers that have a mismatch between the method and the claims and from those with overly grandiose claims. The main recommendation for authors is to make the contribution of the work very clear in their paper. In addition, reviewers viewed data availability and its consistency as being important.

We introduce a novel method of removing foreground objects from distant galaxy ($z > 3$) images that makes use of the Lyman-break at 912{\AA}, in what we call `2-D Lyman-Break Imaging'. The images used are in the rest-frame optical at $z < 3$ and progressively bluer bands at $z > 3$. They are therefore subject to K-correction and cosmological dimming effects which are tested and corrected for. We separately consider a mass-selected sample (with masses in the range 10$^9$M$_{\odot}$$\leq$M$_*$$\leq$10$^{10.5}$M$_{\odot}$) and a number density selected sample (using a constant number density of $n = 1\times10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-3}$). Instead of utilising the commonly used, but potentially biased, effective radii for size measurements, we measure the redshift-independent Petrosian radius, defined by the parameter $\eta$, for each galaxy for three values of $\eta$ and use this as a proxy for size. The evolution of the measured radii can be described by a power-law of the form $R_{Petr} = \alpha(1+z)^\beta$kpc where $\beta < 0$. We find that the outer radius increases more rapidly, suggesting that as a galaxy grows mass is added to its outer regions via an inside-out growth. This growth is stronger for the number density selected sample, with a growth rate of nearly three in the outer radii compared to the inner.

Based on radiative transfer (RT) models of clumpy AGN tori, hot dust emission from the torus contributes negligibly to the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) at $\lambda\ga100$ \micron. However, these models do not include AGN heating of host-galaxy-scale diffuse dust, which may have far-IR (FIR) colors comparable to cold diffuse dust heated by stars. To quantify the contribution of AGN heating to host-galaxy-scale cold dust emission at $\lambda\ga100$ \micron, we perform dust RT calculations on a simulated galaxy merger both including and excluding the bright AGN that it hosts. By differencing the SEDs yielded by RT calculations with and without AGN that are otherwise identical, we quantify the FIR cold dust emission arising solely from re-processed AGN photons. In extreme cases, AGN-heated host-galaxy-scale dust can increase galaxy-integrated FIR flux densities by factors of 2-4; star formation rates calculated from the FIR luminosity assuming no AGN contribution can overestimate the true value by comparable factors. Because the FIR colors of such systems are similar to those of purely star-forming galaxies and redder than torus models, broadband SED decomposition may be insufficient for disentangling the contributions of stars and heavily dust-enshrouded AGN in the most IR-luminous galaxies. We demonstrate how kpc-scale resolved observations can be used to identify deeply dust-enshrouded AGN with cool FIR colors when spectroscopic and/or X-ray detection methods are unavailable.

The feedback methods are as robust as previous models on individual cloud scales (e.g. Dale et al.). We find that photoionization dominates the disruption of the spiral arm section, with stellar winds only producing small cavities (at most $\sim$ 30 pc). Stellar winds do not affect the resulting cloud statistics or the integrated star formation rate/efficiency, unlike ionization, which produces more stars, and more clouds of higher density and higher velocity dispersion compared to the control run without feedback.

RC is a particularly challenging test case, as token-level attributions that have been extensively studied in other NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis are less suitable to represent the reasoning that RC models perform. We construct counterfactual sets for three different RC settings, and through heuristics that can connect attribution methods' outputs to high-level model behavior, we can evaluate how useful different attribution methods and even different formats are for understanding counterfactuals. We find that pairwise attributions are better suited to RC than token-level attributions across these different RC settings, with our best performance coming from a modification that we propose to an existing pairwise attribution method.

The algorithm is trained and tested using the SDSS/SEGUE spectroscopic dataset and Gaia photometric/astrometric dataset. At [Fe/H]$<-1.2$, the algorithm succeeds in identifying more than 70% of the giants in the training/test set, with a dwarf contamination fraction below 30% (with respect to the SDSS/SEGUE dataset). The photometric metallicity estimates have uncertainties better than 0.2 dex when compared with the spectroscopic measurements. The distances estimated by the algorithm are valid out to a distance of at least $\sim 80$ kpc without requiring any prior on the stellar distribution, and have fully independent uncertainities that take into account both random and systematic errors. These advances allow us to estimate these stellar parameters for approximately 12 million stars in the photometric dataset. This will enable studies involving the chemical mapping of the distant outer disc and the stellar halo, including their kinematics using the Gaia proper motions. This type of algorithm can be applied in the Southern hemisphere to the first release of LSST data, thus providing an almost complete view of the external components of our Galaxy out to at least $\sim 80$ kpc. Critical to the success of these efforts will be ensuring well-defined spectroscopic training sets that sample a broad range of stellar parameters with minimal biases.

In particular, we explore the relationship between the mutual inclination of the USP planet and the quadrupole moment ($J_2$) of the host star.

We include a model for nebular line emission that can employ either precomputed Cloudy lookup tables (for efficiency), or direct photoionization calculations for all young stars (for flexibility). The dust content follows either observationally-motivated prescriptions, direct modeling from galaxy formation simulations, or a novel approach that includes the dust content via learning-based algorithms from the SIMBA cosmological galaxy formation simulation. AGN can additionally be included via a range of prescriptions. The output of these models are broadband SEDs, as well as filter-convolved images. Powderday is designed to eliminate last-mile efforts by researchers that employ different hydrodynamic galaxy formation models, and seamlessly interfaces with GIZMO, AREPO, GASOLINE, CHANGA, and ENZO. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code via three applications: a model for the star formation rate (SFR) - infrared luminosity relation in galaxies (including the impact of AGN); the impact of circumstellar dust around AGB stars on the mid-infrared emission from galaxy SEDs; and the impact of galaxy inclination angle on dust attenuation laws.

In configurable software systems, the combinatorics that arises from the multitude of features a user might select from adds a further layer of complexity. We introduce the notion of feature causality, which is based on counterfactual reasoning and inspired by the seminal definition of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl. Feature causality operates at the level of system configurations and is capable of identifying features and their interactions that are the reason for emerging functional and non-functional properties. We present various methods to explicate these reasons, in particular well-established notions of responsibility and blame that we extend to the feature-oriented setting. Establishing a close connection of feature causality to prime implicants, we provide algorithms to effectively compute feature causes and causal explications. By means of an evaluation on a wide range of configurable software systems, including community benchmarks and real-world systems, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach: We illustrate how our notion of causality facilitates to identify root causes, estimate the effects of features, and detect feature interactions.

Self-shielding can alleviate the effect the LW background has on the H$_2$ within haloes. In this work, we perform a cosmological simulation to study the birthplaces of Pop III stars, using the adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo. We investigate the distribution of host halo masses and its relationship to the LW background intensity. Compared to previous work, haloes form Pop III stars at much lower masses, up to a factor of a few, due to the inclusion of H$_2$ self-shielding. We see no relationship between the LW intensity and host halo mass. Most haloes form multiple Pop III stars, with a median number of four, up to a maximum of 16, at the instance of Pop III formation.

We introduce and study the idea of combining SGD to compute the marginal likelihood with MCMC to explore the model space and show convergence.,https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.13198,"It is common practice to use Laplace approximations to compute marginal likelihoods in Bayesian versions of generalised linear models (GLM). Marginal likelihoods combined with model priors are then used in different search algorithms to compute the posterior marginal probabilities of models and individual covariates. This allows performing Bayesian model selection and model averaging. For large sample sizes, even the Laplace approximation becomes computationally challenging because the optimisation routine involved needs to evaluate the likelihood on the full set of data in multiple iterations. As a consequence, the algorithm is not scalable for large datasets. To address this problem, we suggest using a version of a popular batch stochastic gradient descent (BSGD) algorithm for estimating the marginal likelihood of a GLM by subsampling from the data. We further combine the algorithm with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based methods for Bayesian model selection and provide some theoretical results on the convergence of the estimates.

This opened a rich area of exploration studying this phenomenon. Our motivation is to study the upper limits of this research program: How far will understanding Neural Collapse take us in understanding deep learning? First, we investigate its role in generalization. We refine the Neural Collapse conjecture into two separate conjectures: collapse on the train set (an optimization property) and collapse on the test distribution (a generalization property). We find that while Neural Collapse often occurs on the train set, it does not occur on the test set. We thus conclude that Neural Collapse is primarily an optimization phenomenon, with as-yet-unclear connections to generalization. Second, we investigate the role of Neural Collapse in feature learning. We show simple, realistic experiments where training longer leads to worse last-layer features, as measured by transfer-performance on a downstream task. This suggests that neural collapse is not always desirable for representation learning, as previously claimed. Finally, we give preliminary evidence of a ""cascading collapse"" phenomenon, wherein some form of Neural Collapse occurs not only for the last layer, but in earlier layers as well. We hope our work encourages the community to continue the rich line of Neural Collapse research, while also considering its inherent limitations.

Challenged by the limited memory size of current TEEs, we leverage greedy layer-wise training to train each model's layer inside the trusted area until its convergence. The performance evaluation of our implementation shows that $PPFL$ can significantly improve privacy while incurring small system overheads at the client-side. In particular, $PPFL$ can successfully defend the trained model against data reconstruction, property inference, and membership inference attacks. Furthermore, it can achieve comparable model utility with fewer communication rounds (0.54$\times$) and a similar amount of network traffic (1.002$\times$) compared to the standard federated learning of a complete model.

Here, we consider the likely response of a highly advanced civilization to this situation. In particular, we argue that in order to maximize its access to useable energy, a sufficiently advanced civilization would chose to expand rapidly outward, build Dyson Spheres or similar structures around encountered stars, and use the energy that is harnessed to accelerate those stars away from the approaching horizon and toward the center of the civilization. We find that such efforts will be most effective for stars with masses in the range of $M\sim (0.2-1) M_{\odot}$, and could lead to the harvesting of stars within a region extending out to several tens of Mpc in radius, potentially increasing the total amount of energy that is available to a future civilization by a factor of several thousand.

Simple theoretical expectations indicate that SMBHs in quasars accrete via thin discs which should produce at most very weak jets. This is contradicted by observations of powerful jets in flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). We use gamma-ray luminosities observed with the \emph{fermi} Large Area Telescope as a proxy of the jet power for a population of 154 FSRQs. Assuming typical quasar accretion rates and using black hole mass measurements from a variety of methods, we find a mean jet production efficiency of about 10 per cent for FSRQs, with values as high as 222 per cent. We find that this is consistent with FSRQs hosting moderately thin, magnetically arrested accretion discs around rapidly spinning black holes (BHs). Modeling our observations using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of jets from thin discs, we find an average lower limit of $a_* = 0.59$ for the SMBH spins of FSRQs, with tendency for the spins to decrease as the black hole mass increases. Our results are consistent with the merger-driven evolution of SMBHs. 3 per cent of the sample cannot be explained by current GRMHD models of jet production from Kerr BHs due to the high efficiencies.

We dissect the temporal evolution of the system dynamics along the two distinct phases that characterized the game.

Two notable trends to deal with the communication overhead of federated algorithms are gradient compression and local computation with periodic communication. Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive. We address this by proposing a set of algorithms with periodical compressed (quantized or sparsified) communication and analyze their convergence properties in both homogeneous and heterogeneous local data distribution settings. For the homogeneous setting, our analysis improves existing bounds by providing tighter convergence rates for both strongly convex and non-convex objective functions. To mitigate data heterogeneity, we introduce a local gradient tracking scheme and obtain sharp convergence rates that match the best-known communication complexities without compression for convex, strongly convex, and nonconvex settings.

These variations were interpreted as being due to a resonant perturbation between XO-6b and a hitherto unknown low-mass planet orbiting the same star. To understand this enigmatic planetary system better, we analysed three sectors of data, spanning over seven months, from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which produces high-quality light curves that are well suited to characterizing exoplanets and searching for TTVs.

However, programming robots to control plant motion and shape requires good knowledge of complex plant behaviors. Therefore, we use machine learning to create a holistic plant model and evolve robot controllers. As a benchmark task we choose obstacle avoidance. We use computer vision to construct a model of plant stem stiffening and motion dynamics by training an LSTM network. The LSTM network acts as a forward model predicting change in the plant, driving the evolution of neural network robot controllers. The evolved controllers augment the plants' natural light-finding and tissue-stiffening behaviors to avoid obstacles and grow desired shapes.

To address the high communication costs of distributed training, which is further exacerbated by the fact that modern highly performing models are typically overparameterized, a large body of work has been devoted in recent years to the design of various compression strategies, such as sparsification and quantization, and optimization algorithms capable of using them. Recently, Safaryan et al (2021) pioneered a dramatically different compression design approach: they first use the local training data to form local {\em smoothness matrices}, and then propose to design a compressor capable of exploiting the smoothness information contained therein. While this novel approach leads to substantial savings in communication, it is limited to sparsification as it crucially depends on the linearity of the compression operator. In this work, we resolve this problem by extending their smoothness-aware compression strategy to arbitrary unbiased compression operators, which also includes sparsification. Specializing our results to quantization, we observe significant savings in communication complexity compared to standard quantization. In particular, we show theoretically that block quantization with $n$ blocks outperforms single block quantization, leading to a reduction in communication complexity by an $\mathcal{O}(n)$ factor, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the distributed system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical evidence that our smoothness-aware quantization strategies outperform existing quantization schemes as well the aforementioned smoothness-aware sparsification strategies with respect to all relevant success measures: the number of iterations, the total amount of bits communicated, and wall-clock time.

In the context of quasi-local mass, one is interested in determining if, and for which quasi-local mass definitions, a quasi-local version of these inequalities also holds. It is known that the Brown-York quasi-local mass satisfies a quasi-local Riemannian Penrose inequality, however in the context of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, one expects that a quasi-local Riemannian Penrose inequality should also include a contribution from the electric charge. This article builds on ideas of Lu and Miao and of the first-named author to prove some charged quasi-local Penrose inequalities for a class of compact manifolds with boundary. In particular, we impose that the boundary is isometric to a closed surface in a suitable Reissner-Nordstr\""om manifold, which serves as a reference manifold for the quasi-local mass that we work with.

Traditionally, these tasks have either been considered as separate, or assumed to be implicitly addressed together with high-capacity feature extractors. When considered separately, alignment is usually viewed as a problem of aligning data distributions, either through geometric approaches such as subspace alignment or through distributional alignment such as optimal transport. This paper represents a hybrid approach, where we assume simplified data geometry in the form of subspaces, and consider alignment as an auxiliary task to the primary task of maximizing performance on the source. The alignment is made rather simple by leveraging tractable data geometry in the form of subspaces. We synergistically allow certain parameters derived from the closed-form auxiliary solution, to be affected by gradients from the primary task. The proposed approach represents a unique fusion of geometric and model-based alignment with gradients from a data-driven primary task.

Historically the ""Lithium test"", a search for the presence and strength of the Li line at 670.8 nm, has been a marker if an object has a substellar mass with stellar-like spectral energy distribution (e.g., a late-type M dwarf). While the Li test could in principle also be used to distinguish masses of later-type L-T dwarfs, Li is predominantly no longer found as an atomic gas, but rather a molecular species such as LiH, LiF, LiOH, and LiCl in their cooler atmospheres. L- and T-type brown dwarfs are also quite faint at 670 nm and thus challenging targets for high resolution spectroscopy.

Detailed theoretical studies are necessary to investigate the range of spectra we can expect to see from these objects throughout their orbit, because of the extreme temperature and chemical longitudinal gradients that exist across day and nightside regions. Using previously published 3D GCM models of WASP-76b with different treatments of magnetic drag, we post-process the 3D atmospheres to generate high-resolution emission spectra for two wavelength ranges and throughout the planet's orbit. We find that the high-resolution emission spectra vary strongly as a function of phase, at times showing emission features, absorption features, or both, which are a direct result of the 3D structure of the planet. At phases exhibiting both emission and absorption features, the Doppler shift differs in direction between the two spectral features, making them differentiable instead of canceling each other out. Through the use of cross-correlation, we find different patterns in net Doppler shift for models with different treatments of drag: the nightside spectra show opposite signs in their Doppler shift, while the dayside phases have a reversal in the trend of net shift with phase. Finally, we caution researchers from using a single spectral template throughout the planet's orbit; this can bias the corresponding net Doppler shift returned, as it can pick up on a bright region on the edge of the planet disk that is highly red- or blue-shifted.

Consequently, higher-order drag force statistics, arising from neighbor-induced flow perturbations, are not accounted for; with implications on predictions for particle velocity variance and dispersion. We develop a force Langevin (FL) model that treats neighbor-induced drag fluctuations as a stochastic force within an EL framework. The stochastic drag force follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and requires closure of the integral time scale for the fluctuating hydrodynamic force and the standard deviation in drag. The former is closed using the mean-free time between successive collisions, derived from the kinetic theory of non-uniform gases. For the latter, particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PR--DNS) of fixed particle assemblies is utilized to develop a correlation. The stochastic EL framework specifies unresolved drag force statistics, leading to the correct evolution and sustainment of particle velocity variance over a wide range of Reynolds numbers and solids volume fractions when compared to PR--DNS of freely-evolving homogeneous suspensions. By contrast, standard EL infers drag statistics from variations in the resolved flow and thus under-predicts the growth and steady particle velocity variance in homogeneous suspensions. Velocity statistics from standard EL approaches are found to depend on the bandwidth of the projection function used for two-way momentum coupling, while results obtained from the stochastic EL approach are insensitive to the projection bandwidth.

RSD is typically measured in $3D$ redshift space, but WL is inherently a projected signal, making angular statistics a natural choice for the combined analysis. Thus, we determine the amount of RSD information that can be extracted using projected statistics. Specifically we perform a Fisher analysis to forecast constraints and model bias comparing two different Fingers-of-God (FoG) models using both, the $3D$ power spectrum, $P(k, \mu)$, and tomographic $C(\ell)$. We find that because na\""ive tomographic projection mixes large scales with poorly modelled nonlinear radial modes, it does not provide competitive constraints to the $3D$ RSD power spectrum without the model bias becoming unacceptably large. This is true even in the limit of narrow tomographic bins. In light of this we propose a new radial weighting scheme which unmixes radial RSD scales in projection yielding competitive constraints to the $3D$ RSD power spectrum, while keeping the model bias small.

In contrast, limited knowledge has been gained on possible universal characteristics in the non-equilibrium evolution of systems in quantum critical phases. In this context, universality is generically attributed to the insensitivity of observables to the microscopic system parameters and initial conditions. Here, we present such a universal feature in the equilibration dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonian -- a paradigmatic system of disordered, all-to-all interacting fermions that has been designed as a phenomenological description of quantum critical regions. We drive the system far away from equilibrium by performing a global quench, and track how its ensemble average relaxes to a steady state. Employing state-of-the-art numerical simulations for the exact evolution, we reveal that the disorder-averaged evolution of few-body observables, including the quantum Fisher information and low-order moments of local operators, exhibit within numerical resolution a universal equilibration process. Under a straightforward rescaling, data that correspond to different initial states collapse onto a universal curve, which can be well approximated by a Gaussian throughout large parts of the evolution. To reveal the physics behind this process, we formulate a general theoretical framework based on the Novikov--Furutsu theorem. This framework extracts the disorder-averaged dynamics of a many-body system as an effective dissipative evolution, and can have applications beyond this work. The exact non-Markovian evolution of the SYK ensemble is very well captured by Bourret--Markov approximations, which contrary to common lore become justified thanks to the extreme chaoticity of the system, and universality is revealed in a spectral analysis of the corresponding Liouvillian.

I should write … <LINK>",https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08522,"Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalize remarkably well without explicit regularization even in the strongly over-parametrized regime where classical learning theory would instead predict that they would severely overfit. While many proposals for some kind of implicit regularization have been made to rationalise this success, there is no consensus for the fundamental reason why DNNs do not strongly overfit. In this paper, we provide a new explanation. By applying a very general probability-complexity bound recently derived from algorithmic information theory (AIT), we argue that the parameter-function map of many DNNs should be exponentially biased towards simple functions. We then provide clear evidence for this strong simplicity bias in a model DNN for Boolean functions, as well as in much larger fully connected and convolutional networks applied to CIFAR10 and MNIST. As the target functions in many real problems are expected to be highly structured, this intrinsic simplicity bias helps explain why deep networks generalize well on real world problems. This picture also facilitates a novel PAC-Bayes approach where the prior is taken over the DNN input-output function space, rather than the more conventional prior over parameter space. If we assume that the training algorithm samples parameters close to uniformly within the zero-error region then the PAC-Bayes theorem can be used to guarantee good expected generalization for target functions producing high-likelihood training sets. By exploiting recently discovered connections between DNNs and Gaussian processes to estimate the marginal likelihood, we produce relatively tight generalization PAC-Bayes error bounds which correlate well with the true error on realistic datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR10 and for architectures including convolutional and fully connected networks.

TI qubits have fundamental advantages over other technologies such as superconducting qubits, including high qubit quality, coherence and connectivity. However, current TI systems are small in size, with 5-20 qubits and typically use a single trap architecture which has fundamental scalability limitations. To progress towards the next major milestone of 50-100 qubits, a modular architecture termed the Quantum Charge Coupled Device (QCCD) has been proposed. In a QCCD-based TI device, small traps are connected through ion shuttling. While the basic hardware components for such devices have been demonstrated, building a 50-100 qubit system is challenging because of a wide range of design possibilities for trap sizing, communication topology and gate implementations and the need to match diverse application resource requirements. Towards realizing QCCD systems with 50-100 qubits, we perform an extensive architectural study evaluating the key design choices of trap sizing, communication topology and operation implementation methods. We built a design toolflow which takes a QCCD architecture's parameters as input, along with a set of applications and realistic hardware performance models. Our toolflow maps the applications onto the target device and simulates their execution to compute metrics such as application run time, reliability and device noise rates. Using six applications and several hardware design points, we show that trap sizing and communication topology choices can impact application reliability by up to three orders of magnitude. Microarchitectural gate implementation choices influence reliability by another order of magnitude. From these studies, we provide concrete recommendations to tune these choices to achieve highly reliable and performant application executions.

However, there has been considerably less success using these models for high-dimensional learning and estimation problems. In this work, we show that, for a variety of high-dimensional learning and estimation problems, both the shuffle model and the pan-private model inherently incur an exponential price in sample complexity relative to the central model. For example, we show that, private agnostic learning of parity functions over $d$ bits requires $\Omega(2^{d/2})$ samples in these models, and privately selecting the most common attribute from a set of $d$ choices requires $\Omega(d^{1/2})$ samples, both of which are exponential separations from the central model.

This suggests that BBHs cannot be formed solely through dynamical capture in dense stellar environments. <LINK>,https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10580,"The distribution of effective spin $\chi_{\rm eff}$, a parameter that encodes the degree of spin-orbit alignment in a binary system, has been widely regarded as a robust discriminator between the isolated and dynamical formation pathways for merging binary black holes. Until the recent release of the GWTC-2 catalog, such tests have yielded inconclusive results due to the small number of events with measurable nonzero spins. In this work, we study the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution of the binary black holes detected in the LIGO-Virgo O1-O3a observing runs. Our focus is on the degree to which the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is symmetric about $\chi_{\rm eff} = 0$ and whether the data provides support for a population of negative-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ systems. We find that the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution is asymmetric at 95% credibility, with an excess of aligned-spin binary systems ($\chi_{\rm eff}>0$) over anti-aligned ones. Moreover, we find that there is no evidence for negative-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ systems in the current population of binary black holes. Thus, based solely on the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution, dynamical formation is disfavored as being responsible for the entirety of the observed merging binary black holes, while isolated formation remains viable. We also study the mass distribution of the current binary black hole population, confirming that a single truncated power law distribution in the primary source-frame mass, $m_1^{\rm src}$, fails to describe the observations. Instead, we find that the preferred models have a steep feature at $m_1^{\rm src} \sim 40 \,\rm M_\odot$ consistent with a step and an extended, shallow tail to high masses.

It is favorable to learn those constraints once and then transfer them over different tasks within the same workspace. We address this problem by representing constraint knowledge with transferable primitives and using Bayesian optimization (BO) based on these primitives to guide binding search in further tasks. Via semantic and geometric backtracking in TAMP, we construct constraint primitives to encode the geometric constraints respectively in a reusable form. Then we devise a BO approach to efficiently utilize the accumulated constraints for guiding node expansion of an MCTS-based binding planner.

Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) is a promising self-supervised RL paradigm, wherein the free parameters of an underspecified environment are automatically adapted during training to the agent's capabilities, leading to the emergence of diverse training environments. Here, we cast Prioritized Level Replay (PLR), an empirically successful but theoretically unmotivated method that selectively samples randomly-generated training levels, as UED. We argue that by curating completely random levels, PLR, too, can generate novel and complex levels for effective training. This insight reveals a natural class of UED methods we call Dual Curriculum Design (DCD). Crucially, DCD includes both PLR and a popular UED algorithm, PAIRED, as special cases and inherits similar theoretical guarantees. This connection allows us to develop novel theory for PLR, providing a version with a robustness guarantee at Nash equilibria. Furthermore, our theory suggests a highly counterintuitive improvement to PLR: by stopping the agent from updating its policy on uncurated levels (training on less data), we can improve the convergence to Nash equilibria. Indeed, our experiments confirm that our new method, PLR$^{\perp}$, obtains better results on a suite of out-of-distribution, zero-shot transfer tasks, in addition to demonstrating that PLR$^{\perp}$ improves the performance of PAIRED, from which it inherited its theoretical framework.

By jointly modeling the 12-filter optical-mid-infrared (MIR) photometry and spectroscopy of the host, we infer a median stellar mass of $\approx 2 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, internal dust extinction of $A_V\approx 1-1.5$ mag, and a mass-weighted stellar population age of $\approx 5-6$ Gyr. Connecting these data to the radio and X-ray observations, we cannot reconcile the broad-band behavior with strong AGN activity and instead attribute the dominant source of persistent radio emission to star formation, likely originating from the circumnuclear region of the host. The modeling also indicates a hot dust component contributing to the MIR luminosity at a level of $\approx 10-30\%$.

In this study we summarize the complexities and uncertainties of state-of-the-art planet formation models and how they influence planetary atmospheric compositions. We introduce a methodology that explores the effect of different formation model assumptions when interpreting atmospheric compositions. We apply this framework to the directly imaged planet HR 8799e. Based on its atmospheric composition, this planet may have migrated significantly during its formation. We show that including the chemical evolution of the protoplanetary disk leads to a reduced need for migration. Moreover, we find that pebble accretion can reproduce the planet's composition, but some of our tested setups lead to too low atmospheric metallicities, even when considering that evaporating pebbles may enrich the disk gas.

The array cluster can then perform localization on a manifold defined by the PCA of concatenated DOAs over time. The second proposed method performs localization using an affine transformation between the DOA vectors and the room manifold. The PCA has fewer requirements on the training sequence, but is less robust to missing DOAs from one of the arrays. The methods are demonstrated with five IoT 8-microphone circular arrays, placed at unspecified fixed locations in an office. Both the PCA and the affine method can easily map out a rectangle based on a few anchor points with similar accuracy.

Drawing from twenty interviews, this paper makes several contributions: we describe how small communities provide unique informational and interactional spaces for participants, who are drawn by the hyperspecific aspects of the community; we find that small communities do not promote strong dyadic interpersonal relationships but rather promote group-based identity; and we highlight how participation in small communities is part of a broader, ongoing strategy to curate participants' online experience.

In text recognition, we reveal another such shortcut, whereby recognizers overly depend on local image statistics. Motivated by this, we suggest an approach to regulate the reliance on local statistics that improves text recognition performance. Our method, termed TextAdaIN, creates local distortions in the feature map which prevent the network from overfitting to local statistics. It does so by viewing each feature map as a sequence of elements and deliberately mismatching fine-grained feature statistics between elements in a mini-batch. Despite TextAdaIN's simplicity, extensive experiments show its effectiveness compared to other, more complicated methods. TextAdaIN achieves state-of-the-art results on standard handwritten text recognition benchmarks. Additionally, it generalizes to multiple architectures and to the domain of scene text recognition.

In this setting, direct calculation of summaries from data, such as the minimum over a space-time domain, is not possible. To obtain predictive distributions for such cluster summaries, we propose a two-step approach. We first model marginal distributions with a focus on accurate modeling of the right tail and then, after transforming the data to a standard Gaussian scale, we estimate a Gaussian space-time dependence model defined locally in the time domain for the space-time subregions where we want to predict. In the first step, we detrend the mean and standard deviation of the data and fit a spatially resolved generalized Pareto distribution to apply a correction of the upper tail. To ensure spatial smoothness of the estimated trends, we either pool data using nearest-neighbor techniques, or apply generalized additive regression modeling. To cope with high space-time resolution of data, the local Gaussian models use a Markov representation of the Mat\'ern correlation function based on the stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) approach. In the second step, they are fitted in a Bayesian framework through the integrated nested Laplace approximation implemented in R-INLA. Finally, posterior samples are generated to provide statistical inferences through Monte-Carlo estimation. Motivated by the 2019 Extreme Value Analysis data challenge, we illustrate our approach to predict the distribution of local space-time minima in anomalies of Red Sea surface temperatures, using a gridded dataset (11315 days, 16703 pixels) with artificially generated gaps.

This fragmentation length-scale can be related to filament properties, such as the width and the dynamical state of the filament. Here we present a study of a number of fragmentation analysis techniques applied to filaments, and their sensitivity to characteristic fragmentation length-scales. We test the sensitivity to both single-tier and two-tier fragmentation, i.e. when the fragmentation can be characterised with one or two fragmentation length-scales respectively. The nearest neighbour separation, minimum spanning tree separation and two-point correlation function are all able to robustly detect characteristic fragmentation length-scales. The Fourier power spectrum and the Nth nearest neighbour technique are both poor techniques, and require very little scatter in the core spacings for the characteristic length-scale to be successfully determined. We develop a null hypothesis test to compare the results of the nearest neighbour and minimum spanning tree separation distribution with randomly placed cores. We show that a larger number of cores is necessary to successfully reject the null hypothesis if the underlying fragmentation is two-tier, N>20. Once the null is rejected we show how one may decide if the observed fragmentation is best described by single-tier or two-tier fragmentation, using either Akaike's information criterion or the Bayes factor.

This line of reasoning has led to an outbreak of adversarial based approaches for NLG, on the account that GANs do not suffer from exposure bias. In this work, we make several surprising observations which contradict common beliefs. First, we revisit the canonical evaluation framework for NLG, and point out fundamental flaws with quality-only evaluation: we show that one can outperform such metrics using a simple, well-known temperature parameter to artificially reduce the entropy of the model's conditional distributions. Second, we leverage the control over the quality / diversity trade-off given by this parameter to evaluate models over the whole quality-diversity spectrum and find MLE models constantly outperform the proposed GAN variants over the whole quality-diversity space. Our results have several implications: 1) The impact of exposure bias on sample quality is less severe than previously thought, 2) temperature tuning provides a better quality / diversity trade-off than adversarial training while being easier to train, easier to cross-validate, and less computationally expensive.

In this paper we propose a method of decomposing an event sequence into a set of IETs and a burst tree, which exactly captures the structure of temporal correlations that is entirely missing in the analysis of IET distributions. We apply the burst-tree decomposition method to various datasets and analyze the structure of the revealed burst trees. In particular, we observe that event sequences show similar burst-tree structure, such as heavy-tailed burst size distributions, despite of very different IET distributions. The burst trees allow us to directly characterize the preferential and assortative mixing structure of bursts responsible for the higher-order temporal correlations. We also show how to use the decomposition method for the systematic investigation of such higher-order correlations captured by the burst trees in the framework of randomized reference models. Finally, we devise a simple kernel-based model for generating event sequences showing appropriate higher-order temporal correlations.

In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the audience's view, and the coordination of a presenter's video with interactive visualization.

To increase its robustness to outlier languages, we create two variants of MAML based on alternative criteria: Minimax MAML reduces the maximum risk across languages, while Neyman-Pearson MAML constrains the risk in each language to a maximum threshold. Both criteria constitute fully differentiable two-player games. In light of this, we propose a new adaptive optimiser solving for a local approximation to their Nash equilibrium.

The system's optical light curve is dominated by large-amplitude ellipsoidal variability but also exhibits additional scatter, likely driven by pulsations. The proto-WD is cooler ($T_{\rm eff} = 6800\pm 100$ K) and more puffy ($\log\left[g/\left({\rm cm\,s^{-2}}\right)\right]=4.74\pm0.07$) than any known extremely low mass (ELM) WD, but hotter than any known cataclysmic variable (CV) donor. It either completely or very nearly fills its Roche lobe ($R/R_{{\rm Roche\,lobe}}=0.99\pm0.01$), suggesting ongoing or recently terminated mass transfer. No dwarf nova-like outbursts have been observed. The spectrum is dominated by the proto-WD but shows tentative hints of H$\alpha$ emission, perhaps due to accretion onto the massive WD. The properties of the system are well-matched by MESA binary evolution models of CVs with donors that underwent significant nuclear evolution before the onset of mass transfer. In these models, the bloated proto-WD is either still losing mass via stable Roche lobe overflow or was doing so until very recently. In either case, it is evolving toward higher temperatures at near-constant luminosity to become an ELM WD. If the system is detached, mass transfer likely ended when the donor became too hot for magnetic braking to remain efficient. Evolutionary models predict that the binary will shrink to $P_{\rm orb}\lesssim 10$ minutes within a few Gyr, when it will either merge or become an AM CVn binary.

Even state-of-the-art post-processing methods based on neural networks often solely rely on location-specific predictors that require an interpolation of the physical weather model's spatial forecast fields to the target locations. However, potentially useful predictability information contained in large-scale spatial structures within the input fields is potentially lost in this interpolation step. Therefore, we propose the use of convolutional autoencoders to learn compact representations of spatial input fields which can then be used to augment location-specific information as additional inputs to post-processing models. The benefits of including this spatial information is demonstrated in a case study of 2-m temperature forecasts at surface stations in Germany.

However its use in continuum armed bandit problems has received relatively little attention. We provide the first bounds on the regret of Thompson Sampling for continuum armed bandits under weak conditions on the function class containing the true function and sub-exponential observation noise. Our bounds are realised by analysis of the eluder dimension, a recently proposed measure of the complexity of a function class, which has been demonstrated to be useful in bounding the Bayesian regret of Thompson Sampling for simpler bandit problems under sub-Gaussian observation noise. We derive a new bound on the eluder dimension for classes of functions with Lipschitz derivatives, and generalise previous analyses in multiple regards.
