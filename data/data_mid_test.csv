Generalises both local (gain scheduling) and global (exact linearisation) LPV control with stronger theoretical guarantees,https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08513,"This paper proposes a novel approach to nonlinear state-feedback control design that has three main advantages: (i) it ensures exponential stability and $ \mathcal{L}_2 $-gain performance with respect to a user-defined set of reference trajectories, and (ii) it provides constructive conditions based on convex optimization and a path-integral-based control realization, and (iii) it is less restrictive than previous similar approaches. In the proposed approach, first a virtual representation of the nonlinear dynamics is constructed for which a behavioral (parameter-varying) embedding is generated. Then, by introducing a virtual control contraction metric, a convex control synthesis formulation is derived. Finally, a control realization with a virtual reference generator is computed, which is guaranteed to achieve exponential stability and $ \mathcal{L}_2 $-gain performance for all trajectories of the targeted reference behavior. Connections with the linear-parameter-varying (LPV) theory are also explored showing that the proposed methodology is a generalization of LPV state-feedback control in two aspects. First, it is a unified generalization of the two distinct categories of LPV control approaches: global and local methods. Second, it provides rigorous stability and performance guarantees when applied to the true nonlinear system, while such properties are not guaranteed for tracking control using LPV approaches.

While some progress was made in determining the X-ray detected fraction of MBHs in dwarfs, with typical values ranging from $0\%$ to $6\%$, their overall active fraction, ${\cal A}$, is still largely unconstrained. Here, we develop a theoretical model to predict the multiwavelength active fraction of MBHs in dwarf galaxies starting from first principles and based on the physical properties of the host, namely, its stellar mass and angular momentum content. We find multiwavelength active fractions for MBHs, accreting at typically low rates, ranging from $5\%$ to $22\%$, and increasing with the stellar mass of the host as ${\cal A} \sim(\log_{10}M_{\star})^{4.5}$. If dwarfs are characterized by low-metallicity environments, the active fraction may reach $\sim 30\%$ for the most massive hosts. For galaxies with stellar mass in the range $10^7<M_{\star} [M_{\odot}]<10^{10}$, our predictions are in agreement with occupation fractions derived from simulations and semi-analytical models. Additionally, we provide a fitting formula to predict the probability of finding an active MBH in a dwarf galaxy from observationally derived data. This model will be instrumental to guide future observational efforts to find MBHs in dwarfs.

Second, eliminating adverse interactions amongst tasks, which has been shown to significantly degrade the single-task performance in a multi-task setup (task interference). In this paper, we show that both can be achieved simply by reparameterizing the convolutions of standard neural network architectures into a non-trainable shared part (filter bank) and task-specific parts (modulators), where each modulator has a fraction of the filter bank parameters. Thus, our reparameterization enables the model to learn new tasks without adversely affecting the performance of existing ones.

Given that modern networks are deep, this raises the question of how well modern architectures, like ResNets, are captured by the infinite-width limit. To provide a better approximation, we study ReLU ResNets in the infinite-depth-and-width limit, where both depth and width tend to infinity as their ratio, $d/n$, remains constant. In contrast to the Gaussian infinite-width limit, we show theoretically that the network exhibits log-Gaussian behaviour at initialization in the infinite-depth-and-width limit, with parameters depending on the ratio $d/n$. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that even basic properties of standard ResNet architectures are poorly captured by the Gaussian limit, but remarkably well captured by our log-Gaussian limit.

We have built a complete candidate sample including 104 Gaia-DR2 point sources brighter than $G<20$ mag within one degree of the north Galactic pole (NGP), all with proper motions consistent with zero within 2$\sigma$ uncertainty. In addition to pre-existing spectra, we have secured long-slit spectroscopy of all the remaining candidates and find that all 104 stationary point sources in the field can be classified as either quasars (63) or stars (41). The selection efficiency of the zero-proper-motion criterion at high Galactic latitudes is thus $\approx 60\%$. Based on this complete quasar sample we examine the basic properties of the underlying quasar population within the imposed limiting magnitude. We find that the surface density of quasars is 20 deg$^{-2}$, the redshift distribution peaks at $z\sim1.5$, and that only eight systems ($13^{+5}_{-3}\%$) show significant dust reddening. We then explore the selection efficiency of commonly used optical, near- and mid-infrared quasar identification techniques and find that they are all complete at the $85-90\%$ level compared to the astrometric selection. Finally, we discuss how the astrometric selection can be improved to an efficiency of $\approx70\%$ by including an additional cut requiring parallaxes of the candidates to be consistent with zero within 2$\sigma$. The selection efficiency will further increase with the release of future, more sensitive astrometric measurement from the Gaia mission. This type of selection, purely based on the astrometry of the quasar candidates, is unbiased in terms of colours and emission mechanisms of the quasars and thus provides the most complete census of the quasar population within the limiting magnitude of Gaia.

These variability fractions are higher than those of other young, massive star populations or late-type giants in globular clusters, and can be largely explained by two factors. First, our experiment time baseline is sensitive to long-term intrinsic stellar variability. Second, the proper motion of stars behind spatial inhomogeneities in the foreground extinction screen can lead to variability. We recover the two known Galactic center eclipsing binary systems: IRS 16SW and S4-258 (E60). We constrain the Galactic center eclipsing binary fraction of known early-type stars to be at least $2.4 \pm 1.7\%$.

Recent studies have shown that these issues can at least be partially resolved by taking into account the systematic differences between simulations and observations. This work aims to investigate and address any systematic differences affecting the comparison of simulations with observations. To this aim, we analyzed a set of 24 realistically simulated MoRIA (Models of Realistic dwarfs In Action) dwarf galaxies in an observationally motivated way. We first constructed ""observed"" color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the simulated dwarf galaxies in the typically used V- and I-bands. Then we used the CMD-fitting method to recover their star-formation histories (SFHs) from their observed CMDs. These solved SFHs were then directly compared to the true SFHs from the simulation star-particle data, mainly in terms of the star-formation rate(SFR) and the age-metallicity relation (AMR). We applied a dust extinction prescription to the simulation data to produce observed CMDs affected by dust in star-formation regions. Since future facilities, such as the JWST and E-ELT will focus on the near IR rather than the optical, we also constructed and analyzed CMDs using the I- and H-bands. We find a very good agreement between the recovered and the true SFHs of all the simulated dwarf galaxies in our sample, from the synthetic CMD analysis of their V-I versus I as well as the I-H versus H CMDs. Dust leads to an underestimation of the SFR during the last few hundred million years.

The physical origin of this variability, called S Doradus cycle after its prototype, has remained elusive. Here, we study the feedback of stellar wind mass-loss on the envelope structure in stars near the Eddington limit. We perform a time-dependent hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary calculation, applying a stellar wind mass-loss prescription with a temperature-dependence inspired by the predicted systematic increase in mass-loss rates below 25 kK. We find that when the wind mass-loss rate crosses a well-defined threshold, a discontinuous change in the wind base conditions leads to a restructuring of the stellar envelope. The induced drastic radius and temperature changes, which occur on the thermal timescale of the inflated envelope, impose in turn mass-loss variations that reverse the initial changes, leading to a cycle that lacks a stationary equilibrium configuration. Our proof-of-concept model broadly reproduces the typical observational phenomenology of the S Doradus variability. We identify three key physical ingredients needed to trigger the instability: inflated envelopes in close proximity to the Eddington limit, a temperature range where decreasing opacities do not lead to an accelerating outflow, and a mass-loss rate that increases with decreasing temperature, crossing a critical threshold value within this temperature range. Our scenario and model provide testable predictions, and open the door for a consistent theoretical treatment of the LBV phase in stellar evolution, with consequences for their further evolution as single stars or in binary systems.

But the evolutionary fate of these young massive clusters (YMCs), and whether they can become the old globular clusters (GCs) observed in many galaxies, is determined by a complex interplay of internal dynamical processes and external galactic effects. We present the first star-by-star $N$-body models of massive ($N\sim10^5-10^7$) star clusters formed in a FIRE-2 MHD simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy, with all of the relevant initial conditions and galactic tidal effects extracted directly from the cosmological simulation. We randomly select 895 ($\sim 30\%$) of the YMCs with $ > 6\times10^4M_{\odot}$ from Grudi\'c et al. 2022 and integrate them to the present day using the Cluster Monte Carlo Code, CMC. This procedure predicts a MW-like system with 148 GCs, most of which were formed during the early, bursty mode of star formation in the galaxy. Our GCs are younger, less massive, and more core collapsed than clusters in the Milky Way or M31. This is a direct result of the assembly history and age-metallicity relationship of the GCs' host galaxy: younger clusters are preferentially born in stronger galactic tidal fields and initially retain fewer stellar-mass black holes, causing them to lose mass faster and reach core collapse sooner than their older counterparts. Our results suggest that the masses and core/half-light radii of GCs are shaped not only by internal dynamical processes, but by the specific evolutionary history of their host galaxies as well.

Here we present a novel AGN feedback model, which we have incorporated into the AREPO code, that evolves the black hole mass and spin as the accretion flow proceeds through a thin $\alpha$-disc which we self-consistently couple to a Blandford-Znajek jet. We apply our model to the central region of a typical radio-loud Seyfert galaxy embedded in a hot circumgalactic medium (CGM). We find that jets launched into high pressure environments thermalise efficiently due to the formation of recollimation shocks and the vigorous instabilities that these shocks excite increase the efficiency of the mixing of CGM and jet material. The beams of more overpressured jets, however, are not as readily disrupted by instabilities so the majority of the momentum flux at the jet base is retained out to the head, where the jet terminates in a reverse shock. All jets entrain a significant amount of cold circumnuclear disc material which, while energetically insignificant, dominates the lobe mass together with the hot, entrained CGM material. The jet power evolves significantly due to effective self-regulation by the black hole, fed by secularly-driven, intermittent mass flows. The direction of jets launched directly into the circumnuclear disc changes considerably due to effective Bardeen-Petterson torquing. Interestingly, these jets obliterate the innermost regions of the disc and drive large-scale, multi-phase, turbulent, bipolar outflows.

However, when we injected unchanging phase curve signals into the light curves of other stars and searched for variability, we often saw similar levels of variations as in the HAT-P-7 light curve. Fourier analysis of the HAT-P-7 light curve revealed background red noise from stellar supergranulation on timescales similar to the planet's orbital period.

This paper addresses \emph{interpretable} open-world text classification, where the trained classifier must deal with novel classes during operation. To this end, we extend the recently introduced Tsetlin machine (TM) with a novelty scoring mechanism. The mechanism uses the conjunctive clauses of the TM to measure to what degree a text matches the classes covered by the training data. We demonstrate that the clauses provide a succinct interpretable description of known topics, and that our scoring mechanism makes it possible to discern novel topics from the known ones. Empirically, our TM-based approach outperforms seven other novelty detection schemes on three out of five datasets, and performs second and third best on the remaining, with the added benefit of an interpretable propositional logic-based representation.

However, because of the absence of direct observational constraints, the detailed IMF remains elusive. Nevertheless, numerical simulations agree in broad terms that the first stars were typically massive and should often end their lives in violent, explosive deaths. These fates include extremely luminous pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) and bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the latter arising from the collapse of rapidly rotating progenitor stars into black holes. These high-redshift transients are expected to be within the detection limits of upcoming space telescope missions, allowing to place effective constraints on the shape of the primordial IMF that is not easily accessible with other probes. This paper presents a framework to probe the Pop III IMF, utilizing the cosmological source densities of high-redshift PISNe and GRBs. Considering these transients separately could provide useful constraints on the Pop III IMF, but tighter bounds are obtainable by combining PISN and GRB counts. This combined diagnostic is more robust as it is independent of the underlying Pop III star formation rate density, an unknown prior. Future surveys promise to capture most high-redshift GRBs across the entire sky, but high-redshift PISN searches with future telescopes, e.g. Roman Space Telescope, will likely be substantially incomplete. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that even such lower bounds on the PISN count will be able to provide key constraints on the primordial IMF, in particular, if it is top-heavy or not.

We used the VULCAN chemical kinetic code to compute number densities of species. The temperature-pressure profile of the atmosphere was computed with the HELIOS code. We also utilized the $\tau$-ReX forward model to predict the spectra of planets in primary and secondary eclipses. In order to account for the stellar activity we made use of the observed solar XUV spectrum taken from Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL) as a proxy for an active sun-like star. We find large changes in mixing ratios of most chemical species in planets orbiting A-type stars that radiate strong XUV flux inducing a very effective photodissociation. For some species, these changes can propagate very deep into the planetary atmosphere to pressures of around 1 bar. To observe disequilibrium chemistry we favor hot Jupiters with temperatures Teq=1000 K and ultra-hot Jupiters with Teq=3000$ K that also have temperature inversion in their atmospheres. On the other hand, disequilibrium calculations predict little changes in spectra of planets with intermediate temperatures. We also show that stellar activity similar to the one of the modern Sun drives important changes in mixing ratio profiles of atmospheric species. However, these changes take place at very high atmospheric altitudes and thus do not affect predicted spectra.

We investigate the morphology and temperature gradient of the inner-most regions of the accretion disk around FU Orionis.

We spatially resolve the innermost astronomical unit of the disk and determine the exponent of the temperature gradient of the inner disk to $T=r^{-0.74\pm0.02}$. This agrees with theoretical work that predicts $T = r^{-0.75}$ for actively accreting, steady state disks, a value only obtainable through viscous heating within the disk. We find a disk which extends down to the stellar surface at $0.015\pm0.007$ au where the temperature is found to be $5800\pm700$ K indicating boundary layer accretion.

SMPC enables secret-sharing of private models and client inputs with non-colluding secure servers to compute predictions without leaking model parameters and inputs.

However, many individuals cannot learn to successfully modulate their brain activity, greatly limiting the efficacy of BCI for therapy and for basic scientific inquiry. Previous research suggests that coherent activity across diverse cognitive systems is a hallmark of individuals who can successfully learn to control the BCI. However, little is known about how these distributed networks interact through time to support learning. Here, we address this gap in knowledge by constructing and applying a multimodal network approach to decipher brain-behavior relations in motor imagery-based brain-computer interface learning using MEG. Specifically, we employ a minimally constrained matrix decomposition method (non-negative matrix factorization) to simultaneously identify regularized, covarying subgraphs of functional connectivity, to assess their similarity to task performance, and to detect their time-varying expression. Individuals also displayed marked variation in the spatial properties of subgraphs such as the connectivity between the frontal lobe and the rest of the brain, and in the temporal properties of subgraphs such as the stage of learning at which they reached maximum expression. From these observations, we posit a conceptual model in which certain subgraphs support learning by modulating brain activity in regions important for sustaining attention. To test this model, we use tools that stipulate regional dynamics on a networked system (network control theory), and find that good learners display a single subgraph whose temporal expression tracked performance and whose architecture supports easy modulation of brain regions important for attention.

We present a gas accretion driven mechanism that can build up black hole masses rapidly in dense, gas-rich nuclear star clusters (NSCs). Wind-fed supra-exponential accretion of an initially wandering black hole in NSCs can lead to extremely fast growth, scaling stellar mass remnant seed black holes up to intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). Operating throughout cosmic time, growth via this new channel is modulated by the gas supply, and premature termination results in the formation of lower mass black holes with masses in the range of 50 - few 100 solar masses, filling in the so-called mass gap. However, in most gas-rich NSCs, growth is unimpeded, inevitably leading to the formation of IMBHs with masses ranging from 100 - 100,000 solar masses. A spate of new detection spanning the full range of the IMBH mass function - from the LIGO-VIRGO source GW190521 to the emerging population of 10^5 solar mass black holes harbored in low-mass dwarf galaxies - are revealing this elusive population.

With decreasing irradiation, clouds progressively form on the nightside and cooler western limb followed by the eastern limb and central dayside. We find that clouds significantly modify the radiative transport and affect the observable properties of planets colder than T_irr ~ 3,000~K (T_eq~2,100 K) depending on the clouds' vertical extent. The precise strength of expected effects depends on the assumed parameters, but trends in predicted phase curves emerge from an ensemble of simulations. Clouds lead to larger phase curve amplitudes and smaller phase curve offsets at IR wavelengths, compared to cloud-free models. At optical wavelengths, we predict mostly westward phase curve offsets at intermediate temperatures (T_irr ~ 2,000 - 3,500 K) with clouds confined to the nightside and western limb. If clouds are vertically compact (i.e. on order of a pressure scale height in thickness), their distributions and effects become more complicated as different condensates form at different heights -- some too deep to significantly affect the observable atmosphere.

Electrons and muons running in loops introduce a nontrivial dependence on the momentum transfer due to their relatively light masses. These same loops, and those mediated by tau leptons, break the flavor universality because of mass-dependent electromagnetic radiative corrections. Nuclear physics uncertainties significantly cancel in flavor asymmetries resulting in subpercent relative errors. We find that for low neutrino energies, the cross section can be predicted with a relative precision that is competitive with neutrino-electron scattering.

We demonstrate this ability by incorporating a discontinuous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (DHMC) inference engine that is able to deliver automated and efficient inference for non-differentiable models.

Due to this improvement, fake digital contents have proliferated growing concern and spreading distrust in image content, leading to an urgent need for automated ways to detect these AI-generated fake images. Despite the fact that many face editing algorithms seem to produce realistic human faces, upon closer examination, they do exhibit artifacts in certain domains which are often hidden to the naked eye. In this work, we present a simple way to detect such fake face images - so-called DeepFakes. Our method is based on a classical frequency domain analysis followed by basic classifier. Compared to previous systems, which need to be fed with large amounts of labeled data, our approach showed very good results using only a few annotated training samples and even achieved good accuracies in fully unsupervised scenarios. For the evaluation on high resolution face images, we combined several public datasets of real and fake faces into a new benchmark: Faces-HQ. Given such high-resolution images, our approach reaches a perfect classification accuracy of 100% when it is trained on as little as 20 annotated samples. In a second experiment, in the evaluation of the medium-resolution images of the CelebA dataset, our method achieves 100% accuracy supervised and 96% in an unsupervised setting.

Thus, distinguishing between low reporting rates and low ground-truth incident rates is challenging. We develop a method to identify (heterogeneous) reporting rates, without using external (proxy) ground truth data. Our insight is that rates on $\textit{duplicate}$ reports about the same incident can be leveraged, to turn the question into a standard Poisson rate estimation task -- even though the full incident reporting interval is also unobserved.

To preserve malicious functionality, previous attacks either add bytes to existing non-functional areas of the file, potentially limiting their effectiveness, or require running computationally-demanding validation steps to discard malware variants that do not correctly execute in sandbox environments. In this work, we overcome these limitations by developing a unifying framework that does not only encompass and generalize previous attacks against machine-learning models, but also includes three novel attacks based on practical, functionality-preserving manipulations to the Windows Portable Executable (PE) file format. These attacks, named Full DOS, Extend and Shift, inject the adversarial payload by respectively manipulating the DOS header, extending it, and shifting the content of the first section. Our experimental results show that these attacks outperform existing ones in both white-box and black-box scenarios, achieving a better trade-off in terms of evasion rate and size of the injected payload, while also enabling evasion of models that have been shown to be robust to previous attacks. To facilitate reproducibility of our findings, we open source our framework and all the corresponding attack implementations as part of the secml-malware Python library.

Here, we compare four hydrodynamical schemes in idealized simulations of a rising bubble inflated by AGN feedback in a hot stratified ICM: (traditional) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (TSPH), a pressure flavour of SPH (PSPH), a meshless finite mass (MFM) scheme, as well as an Eulerian code with adaptive mesh refinement. In the absence of magnetic fields, the bubble is Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable on short enough time scales to dissolve it fully in the ICM, which is captured by MFM and RAMSES simulations, while in the TSPH simulation the bubble survives. When the ICM is turbulent, mixing of the bubble with the ICM is accelerated. This occurs if the numerical scheme can capture the instabilities well. The differences in the evolution of the bubble has a surprisingly small influence on the thermal structure of the ICM. However, in the simulations with MFM and RAMSES the bubble disruption leads to turbulent stirring of the ICM which is suppressed in SPH. In the latter the thermal energy remains trapped in the bubble and is transported to large radii.

Distinguishing ballistic arrivals (from the cylindrical shock of the fireball)from fragmentation generated signals (quasi-spherical sources) remains a challenge, but are obtainable through analysis of the acoustic path and the timing observed at ground instruments. Here we describe an integrated computer code, termed the Bolide Acoustic Modelling program or BAM, to estimate fireball trajectories and energetics. We develop a new methodology for measuring energy release from bolide fragmentation episodes solely from acoustic measurements and incorporate this into BAM. We also explore the sensitivity of seismo-acoustic fireball solutions and energy estimates to uncertainty in the underlying atmospheric model. Applying BAM to the Stubenberg meteorite producing fireball, we find the total fireball energy from ballistic arrivals to be approximately $5 \times 10^{10}$J which compares favorably to the optical estimate of $4.36 \times 10^{10}$J. The combined fragmentation energy of the Stubenberg event from acoustic data was found to be $1.47^{+0.28}_{-0.12} \times 10^{10}$J, roughly one third of the ballistic or optical total energy.

Entanglement distribution between separate parties is at the core of secure quantum communications. Therefore, understanding its limitations in realistic open-air settings, specially in the rather unexplored microwave regime, is crucial for transforming microwave quantum communications into a mainstream technology. Here, we investigate the feasibility of an open-air entanglement distribution scheme with microwave two-mode squeezed states. First, we study the reach of direct entanglement transmission in open-air, obtaining a maximum distance of approximately 500 meters in a realistic setting with state-of-the-art experimental parameters. Afterwards, we adapt entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping protocols to microwave technology in order to reduce environmental entanglement degradation. While entanglement distillation helps to increase quantum correlations in the short-distance low-squeezing regime by up to $46\%$, entanglement swapping increases the reach by $14\%$.

This paper proposes a novel attention mechanism which we call external attention, based on two external, small, learnable, shared memories, which can be implemented easily by simply using two cascaded linear layers and two normalization layers; it conveniently replaces self-attention in existing popular architectures. External attention has linear complexity and implicitly considers the correlations between all data samples.

From the simulated catalogs, the ML method estimates the amplitude of matter fluctuations, sigma_8, at approximately the expected theoretical limit.

The criteria and routes of escape in one-degree of freedom systems has been well studied theoretically with reasonable agreement with experiment. The trajectory can only transit from the hilltop of the one-dimensional potential energy surface. The situation becomes more complicated when the system has higher degrees of freedom since it has multiple routes to escape through an equilibrium of saddle-type, specifically, an index-1 saddle. This paper summarizes the geometry of escape across a saddle in some widely known physical systems with two degrees of freedom and establishes the criteria of escape providing both a methodology and results under the conceptual framework known as tube dynamics. These problems are classified into two categories based on whether the saddle projection and focus projection in the symplectic eigenspace are coupled or not when damping and/or gyroscopic effects are considered. To simplify the process, only the linearized system around the saddle points are analyzed. We define a transition region, $\mathcal{T}_h$, as the region of initial conditions of a given initial energy $h$ which transit from one side of a saddle to the other. We find that in conservative systems, the boundary of the transition region, $\partial \mathcal{T}_h$, is a cylinder, while in dissipative systems, $\partial \mathcal{T}_h$ is an ellipsoid.

The $J$, $H$, $K1$, and $K2$ spectra from GPI demonstrate the extraordinarily red colors of the object, confirming it as the reddest substellar object observed to date. The significant flux increase throughout the infrared presents a challenging atmosphere to model with existing grids. Best-fit values vary from 1200 K to 1800 K for effective temperature and from 3.0 to 5.0 for log($g$), depending on which individual wavelength band is fit and which model suite is applied. The extreme redness of the companion can be partially reconciled by invoking a high-altitude layer of sub-micron dust particles, similar to dereddening approaches applied to the peculiar red field L-dwarf population. However, reconciling the HD 206893 B spectra with even those of the reddest low-gravity L-dwarf spectra still requires the contribution of additional atmospheric dust, potentially due to the debris disk environment in which the companion resides. Orbit fitting from four years of astrometric monitoring is consistent with a $\sim$30-year period, orbital inclination of 147$^{\circ}$, and semimajor axis of 10 au, well within the estimated disk inner radius of $\sim$50 au.

We include new prescriptions in \texttt{CMC} for the formation of binaries through giant star collisions and tidal captures, and we show that these mechanisms play a crucial role in the formation of neutron star binaries and millisecond pulsars in 47 Tuc; our best-fit model contains $\sim 50$ millisecond pulsars, $80\%$ of which are formed through giant collisions and tidal captures. Our models also suggest that 47 Tuc presently contains up to $\sim 200$ stellar-mass black holes, $\sim 5$ binary black holes, $\sim 15$ low-mass X-ray binaries, and $\sim 300$ cataclysmic variables.

Complementary analyses. <LINK>,https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08646,"When consequential decisions are informed by algorithmic input, individuals may feel compelled to alter their behavior in order to gain a system's approval. Models of agent responsiveness, termed ""strategic manipulation,"" analyze the interaction between a learner and agents in a world where all agents are equally able to manipulate their features in an attempt to ""trick"" a published classifier. In cases of real world classification, however, an agent's ability to adapt to an algorithm is not simply a function of her personal interest in receiving a positive classification, but is bound up in a complex web of social factors that affect her ability to pursue certain action responses. In this paper, we adapt models of strategic manipulation to capture dynamics that may arise in a setting of social inequality wherein candidate groups face different costs to manipulation. We find that whenever one group's costs are higher than the other's, the learner's equilibrium strategy exhibits an inequality-reinforcing phenomenon wherein the learner erroneously admits some members of the advantaged group, while erroneously excluding some members of the disadvantaged group. We also consider the effects of interventions in which a learner subsidizes members of the disadvantaged group, lowering their costs in order to improve her own classification performance. Here we encounter a paradoxical result: there exist cases in which providing a subsidy improves only the learner's utility while actually making both candidate groups worse-off--even the group receiving the subsidy. Our results reveal the potentially adverse social ramifications of deploying tools that attempt to evaluate an individual's ""quality"" when agents' capacities to adaptively respond differ.

Secondary eclipse mapping is a powerful way to map the 3D distribution of the atmosphere, but the data can have large correlations and errors in the presence of photon and instrument noise. We develop a technique to mitigate the large uncertainties of eclipse maps by identifying a small number of dominant spectra to make them more tractable for individual analysis via atmospheric retrieval. We use the eigencurves method to infer a multi-wavelength map of a planet from spectroscopic secondary eclipse light curves. We then apply a clustering algorithm to the planet map to identify several regions with similar emergent spectra. We combine the similar spectra together to construct an ""eigenspectrum"" for each distinct region on the planetary map. We demonstrate how this approach could be used to isolate hot from cold regions and/or regions with different chemical compositions in observations of hot Jupiters with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

We present a suite of 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of binary star systems with circumprimary self-gravitating discs, which include a realistic approximation to radiation transport, and extensively explore the companion's orbital parameter space for configurations which may trigger fragmentation. We identify a ""sweet spot"" where intermediate separation binary companions ($100$ AU $\lesssim a\lesssim400$ AU) can cause a marginally stable disc to fragment. The exact range of ideal binary separations is a function of the companion's eccentricity, inclination and mass. Heating is balanced by efficient cooling, and fragmentation occurs inside a spiral mode driven by the companion. Short separation, disc penetrating binary encounters ($a\lesssim100$ AU) are prohibitive to fragmentation, as mass stripping and disc heating quench any instability. This is also true of binary companions with high orbital eccentricities ($e\gtrsim0.75$). Wide separation companions ($a\gtrsim500$ AU) have little effect on the disc properties for the setup parameters considered here.

Tweetorial follows!: Suppose genetic variants influence the outcome not via the risk factor (hence are not valid instruments), but pleiotropic pathways operate via a measured variable. Then we can perform multivariable Mendelian randomization including the variable to recover an unbiased estimate. However, there may be multiple different measured potentially pleiotropic variables. If we ignore them, then we get bias, but if we adjust for all of them, we will typically have an inefficient estimate as not all the pathways may influence the outcome. Additionally, if there are more potentially pleiotropic variables than genetic variants, then we can't include all variables in the analysis model. We have developed a lasso approach that only includes relevant pleiotropic variables in the analysis - hence the estimate is unbiased, but more efficient than that including all variables. The approach is implemented using summarized genetic association data. One problem is inference post-variable selection - we discuss this at length in the paper. Thanks to Stijn Vansteelandt for helpful conversations on this topic. We present as an example the effect of serum urate on coronary heart disease risk, showing that blood pressure is the key pleiotropic variable, and that the estimated direct effect of urate on CHD risk not via blood pressure is substantially attenuated. We recommend the method when it is believed that pleiotropic effects of genetic predictors of a risk factor could influence the outcome via measured pleiotropic pathways - could use as a main analysis or sensitivity. Comments welcome! @dpsg108 True, could be either direct (horizontal) or indirect (vertical/mediated) pleiotropy.",https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00347,"Valid estimation of a causal effect using instrumental variables requires that all of the instruments are independent of the outcome conditional on the risk factor of interest and any confounders. In Mendelian randomization studies with large numbers of genetic variants used as instruments, it is unlikely that this condition will be met. Any given genetic variant could be associated with a large number of traits, all of which represent potential pathways to the outcome which bypass the risk factor of interest. Such pleiotropy can be accounted for using standard multivariable Mendelian randomization with all possible pleiotropic traits included as covariates. However, the estimator obtained in this way will be inefficient if some of the covariates do not truly sit on pleiotropic pathways to the outcome. We present a method which uses regularization to identify which out of a set of potential covariates need to be accounted for in a Mendelian randomization analysis in order to produce an efficient and robust estimator of a causal effect. The method can be used in the case where individual-level data are not available and the analysis must rely on summary-level data only. It can also be used in the case where there are more covariates under consideration than instruments, which is not possible using standard multivariable Mendelian randomization. We show the results of simulation studies which demonstrate the performance of the proposed regularization method in realistic settings. We also illustrate the method in an applied example which looks at the causal effect of urate plasma concentration on coronary heart disease.

We examine the Fe and $\alpha$-element evolution of 133 Milky Way-like galaxies from the EAGLE simulation, to investigate the origin and diversity of their $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$-$\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ distributions. We find that bimodal $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ distributions arise in galaxies whose gas accretion histories exhibit episodes of significant infall at both early and late times, with the former fostering more intense star formation than the latter. The shorter characteristic consumption timescale of gas accreted in the earlier episode suppresses its enrichment with iron synthesised by Type Ia SNe, resulting in the formation of a high-$\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ sequence. We find that bimodality in $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ similar to that seen in the Galaxy is rare, appearing in approximately 5 percent of galaxies in our sample. We posit that this is a consequence of an early gas accretion episode requiring the mass accretion history of a galaxy's dark matter halo to exhibit a phase of atypically-rapid growth at early epochs.

However, our empirical analysis of the student-school matches shows that about 950 in-group blocking pairs were created each year amongst the disadvantaged group of students, impacting about 650 disadvantaged students. Moreover, we find that this program usually benefits lower-performing disadvantaged students more than the top-performing ones, thus unintentionally creating an incentive to under-perform. In this work, we explore two affirmative action policies that can be used to minimally modify and improve the discovery program: minority reserve (MR) and joint-seat allocation (JSA). We show that (i) both MR and JSA result in no in-group blocking pairs, and (ii) JSA is weakly group strategy-proof, ensures that at least one disadvantaged is not worse off, and when reservation quotas are carefully chosen then no disadvantaged student is worse-off. In the general setting, we show that there is no clear winner in terms of the matchings provided by DISC, JSA and MR, from the perspective of disadvantaged students. We however characterize a condition for markets, that we term high competitiveness, where JSA dominates MR for disadvantaged students. This condition is verified in markets when there is a higher demand for seats than supply, and the performances of disadvantaged students are significantly lower than that of advantaged students. Data from NYC DOE satisfy the high competitiveness condition, and for this dataset our empirical results corroborate our theoretical predictions, showing the superiority of JSA.

We aim at connecting morphology and star-formation properties of low-mass galaxies (median stellar mass $\sim$ 10$^{8.5}$ M$_{\odot}$) at low redshift ($z<0.36$). We use a sample of medium-band selected star-forming galaxies from the GOODS-North field. H$\alpha$ images for the sample are created combining both spectral energy distribution fits and HST data. Using them, we mask the star forming regions to obtain an unbiased two-dimensional model of the light distribution of the host galaxies. For this purpose we use $\texttt{PHI}$, a new Bayesian photometric decomposition code. We apply it independently to 7 HST bands assuming a S\'ersic surface brightness model. Star-forming galaxy hosts show low S\'ersic index (with median $n$ $\sim$ 0.9), as well as small sizes (median $R_e$ $\sim$ 1.6 kpc), and negligible change of the parameters with wavelength (except for the axis ratio, which grows with wavelength). Using a clustering algorithm, we find two different classes of star-forming galaxies: A more compact, redder, and high-$n$ (class A) and a more extended, bluer and lower-$n$ one (class B). We also find evidence that the first class is more spheroidal-like. In addition, we find that 48% of the analyzed galaxies present negative color gradients (only 5% are positive). The host component of low-mass star-forming galaxies at $z<0.36$ separates into two different classes, similar to what has been found for their higher mass counterparts. The results are consistent with an evolution from class B to class A.

A common misconception is that the environmental sciences are immune to such unintended consequences when AI is being used, as most data come from observations, and AI algorithms are based on mathematical formulas, which are often seen as objective. In this article, we argue the opposite can be the case. Using specific examples, we demonstrate many ways in which the use of AI can introduce similar consequences in the environmental sciences.

Here we use stratified Monte Carlo to considerably reduce the bias induced by data resampling. We also show empirically that it is possible to obtain reliable inference using a larger than usual ABC threshold. Finally, we show that with stratified Monte Carlo we obtain a less variable ABC likelihood. Ultimately we show how our approach improves the computational efficiency of the ABC samplers. We construct several ABC samplers employing our methodology, such as rejection and importance ABC samplers, and ABC-MCMC samplers. We consider simulation studies for static (Gaussian, g-and-k distribution, Ising model, astronomical model) and dynamic models (Lotka-Volterra). We compare against state-of-art sequential Monte Carlo ABC samplers, synthetic likelihoods, and likelihood-free Bayesian optimization.

A barrier to proactive maintenance is the city's inability to predict the risk of failure on parts of its infrastructure. In response, we worked with the city to build a ML system to assess the risk of a water mains breaking. Using historical data on which mains have failed, descriptors of pipes, and other data sources, we evaluated several models' abilities to predict breaks three years into the future.

The galaxy's unusual spectral features (P Cygni-like profiles with $\sim$800 km s$^{-1}$ blueshifted absorption lines) have resulted in conflicting interpretations of the nature of this source in the literature. However, analysis of new Gemini spectroscopy reveals the broad emission has begun to fade after being persistent for over a decade prior. Precise difference imaging light curves constructed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Survey reveal small-amplitude optical variability of $\sim$0.1 mag in the g band offset by $100\pm21$ pc from the brightest pixel of the host. The light curve is well-described by an active galactic nuclei (AGN)-like damped random walk process.

This work highlights the challenges of discriminating between scenarios in such extreme environments, relevant to searches for AGNs in dwarf galaxies.

In this paper, we derive explicit expressions for the higher genus partition functions of a specific class of CFTs: code CFTs, which are constructed using classical error-correcting codes. In this setting, the $\mathrm{Sp}(2g,\mathbb Z)$ modular transformations of genus $g$ Riemann surfaces can be recast as a simple set of linear maps acting on $2^g$ polynomial variables, which comprise an object called the code enumerator polynomial. The CFT partition function is directly related to the enumerator polynomial, meaning that solutions of the linear constraints from modular invariance immediately give a set of seemingly consistent partition functions at a given genus. We then find that higher genus constraints, plus consistency under degeneration limits of the Riemann surface, greatly reduces the number of possible code CFTs. This work provides a step towards a full understanding of the constraints from higher genus modular invariance on 2d CFTs.

In this work, we introduce a probabilistic approach that connects these perspectives based on variational inference in a single deep autoencoder model. Specifically, we propose to bound the approximate posterior by fitting regions of high density on the basis of correctly classified data points. These bounds are shown to serve a dual purpose: unseen unknown out-of-distribution data can be distinguished from already trained known tasks towards robust application. Simultaneously, to retain already acquired knowledge, a generative replay process can be narrowed to strictly in-distribution samples, in order to significantly alleviate catastrophic interference.

Such a transformation implies an accompanied change in the global distribution of molecular hydrogen column densities ($N_{\rm{H_2}}$). Using observations by PHANGS-ALMA/SDSS and simulations by GRIFFIN/IllustrisTNG we explore the evolution of this H$_2$ column density distribution function [$f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$]. The H$_2$ (and HI) column density maps for TNG50 and TNG100 are derived in post-processing and are made available through the IllustrisTNG online API. The shape and normalization of $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ of individual main-sequence star-forming galaxies are correlated with the star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (${M_*}$), and H$_2$ mass ($M_{\rm{H}_2}$) in both observations and simulations. TNG100, combined with H$_2$ post-processing models, broadly reproduces observations, albeit with differences in slope and normalization. Also, an analytically modelled $f(N)$, based on exponential gas disks, matches well with the simulations. The GRIFFIN simulation gives first indications that the slope of $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ might not majorly differ when including non-equilibrium chemistry in simulations. The $f(N_{\rm{H}_2})$ by TNG100 implies that higher molecular gas column densities are reached at $z=3$ than at $z=0$. Further, denser regions contribute more to the molecular mass density at $z=3$. Finally, H$_2$ starts dominating compared to HI only at column densities above log($N_{\rm{H}_2} / \rm{cm}^{-2}) \sim 21.8-22$ at both redshifts. These results imply that neutral atomic gas is an important contributor to the overall cold gas mass found in the ISM of galaxies including at densities typical for molecular clouds at $z=0$ and $z=3$.

Using the MIST models, we compute theoretical predictions for absolute SBF magnitudes in the LSST, HST ACS/WFC, and proposed Roman Space Telescope filter systems. We compare our calculations to observed SBF-color relations of systems that span a wide range of age and metallicity. Consistent with previous studies, we find that single-age population models show excellent agreement with observations of low-mass galaxies with $0.5 \lesssim g - i \lesssim 0.9$. For bluer galaxies, the observed relation is better fit by models with composite stellar populations. To study SBF recovery from low-luminosity systems, we perform detailed image simulations in which we inject fully populated model galaxies into deep ground-based images from real observations. Our simulations show that LSST will provide data of sufficient quality and depth to measure SBF magnitudes with precisions of ${\sim}0.2$-0.5 mag in ultra-faint $\left(\mathrm{10^4 \leq M_\star/M_\odot \leq 10^5}\right)$ and low-mass classical (M$_\star\leq10^7$ M$_\odot$) dwarf galaxies out to ${\sim}4$ Mpc and ${\sim}25$ Mpc, respectively, within the first few years of its deep-wide-fast survey. Many significant practical challenges and systematic uncertainties remain, including an irreducible ""sampling scatter"" in the SBFs of ultra-faint dwarfs due to their undersampled stellar mass functions.

Such contingency aware IM is critical for applications for non-profit organizations in low resource communities (e.g., spreading awareness of disease prevention). Despite the initial success, a major practical obstacle in promoting the solutions to more communities is the tremendous runtime of the greedy algorithms and the lack of high performance computing (HPC) for the non-profits in the field -- whenever there is a new social network, the non-profits usually do not have the HPCs to recalculate the solutions.

In particular, a number of surveys have shown that near-IR brightness variability is common among L and T dwarfs. Despite initial understandings of atmospheric dynamics which is the major cause of the variability by previous studies, the detailed mechanism of variability remains elusive, and we need to seek a natural, self-consistent mechanism. Clouds are important in shaping the thermal structure and spectral properties of these atmospheres via large opacity, and we expect the same for inducing atmospheric variability. In this work, using a time-dependent one-dimensional model that incorporates a self-consistent coupling between the thermal structure, convective mixing, cloud radiative heating/cooling and condensation/evaporation of clouds, we show that radiative cloud feedback can drive spontaneous atmospheric variability in both temperature and cloud structure in conditions appropriate for BDs and directly imaged EGPs. The typical periods of variability are one to tens of hours with typical amplitude of the variability up to hundreds of Kelvins in effective temperature. The existence of variability is robust over a wide range of parameter space, but the detailed evolution of variability is sensitive to model parameters. Our novel, self-consistent mechanism has important implications for the observed flux variability of BDs and directly imaged EGPs, especially those evolve in short timescales. It is also a promising mechanism for cloud breaking, which has been proposed to explain the L/T transition of brown dwarfs. ","Atmospheric variability driven by radiative cloud feedback in brown

We provide a detailed introduction to quench spectroscopy for disordered systems and show how spectral properties can be probed using both local operators and two-point correlation functions. We benchmark the technique using the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of a random external potential, focusing on the low-lying excitations, and demonstrate that quench spectroscopy can distinguish the Mott insulator, superfluid, and Bose glass phases. We then explicitly reconstruct the zero-temperature phase diagram of the disordered Bose-Hubbard at fixed filling using two independent methods, both experimentally accessible via time-of-flight imaging and quantum gas microscopy respectively, and demonstrate that quench spectroscopy can give valuable insights as to the distribution of rare regions within disordered systems.

The interplay among the different variables acting over the climate is complex, often leading to correlations across long spatial distances (teleconnections). In some occasions, those teleconnections occur with quite significant temporal shifts that are fundamental for the understanding of the underlying phenomena but which are poorly captured by standard methods. Applying orthogonal decomposition such as Maximum Covariance Analysis (MCA) to geophysical data sets allows to extract common dominant patterns between two different variables, but generally suffers from (i) the non-physical orthogonal constraint as well as (ii) the consideration of simple correlations, whereby temporally offset signals are not detected. Here we propose an extension, complex rotated MCA, to address both limitations. We transform our signals using the Hilbert transform and perform the orthogonal decomposition in complex space, allowing us to correctly correlate out-of-phase signals. Subsequent Varimax rotation removes the orthogonal constraints, leading to more physically meaningful modes of geophysical variability. As an example of application, we have employed this method on sea surface temperature and continental precipitation; our method successfully captures the temporal and spatial interactions between these two variables, namely for (i) the seasonal cycle, (ii) canonical ENSO, (iii) the global warming trend, (iv) the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, (v) ENSO Modoki and finally (vi) the Atlantic Meridional Mode.

Second, provided with the information from the world graph, a high-level Manager quickly finds solution to new tasks and expresses subgoals in reference to pivotal states to a low-level Worker. The Worker can then also leverage the graph to easily traverse to the pivotal states of interest, even across long distance, and explore non-locally.

However, applying SISR successively to each video frame leads to a lack of temporal coherency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) outperform traditional approaches in terms of image quality metrics such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). However, generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a competitive advantage by being able to mitigate the issue of a lack of finer texture details, usually seen with CNNs when super-resolving at large upscaling factors. We present iSeeBetter, a novel GAN-based spatio-temporal approach to video super-resolution (VSR) that renders temporally consistent super-resolution videos. iSeeBetter extracts spatial and temporal information from the current and neighboring frames using the concept of recurrent back-projection networks as its generator. Furthermore, to improve the ""naturality"" of the super-resolved image while eliminating artifacts seen with traditional algorithms, we utilize the discriminator from super-resolution generative adversarial network (SRGAN). Although mean squared error (MSE) as a primary loss-minimization objective improves PSNR/SSIM, these metrics may not capture fine details in the image resulting in misrepresentation of perceptual quality. To address this, we use a four-fold (MSE, perceptual, adversarial, and total-variation (TV)) loss function.

In this study, we explore the relationship between face-area-lightness-measures (FALMs) estimated from images and ground-truth skin readings collected using a device designed to measure human skin. FALMs estimated from different images of the same individual varied significantly relative to ground-truth FALM. This variation was only reduced by greater control of acquisition (camera, background, and environment). Next, we compare ground-truth FALM to Fitzpatrick Skin Types (FST) categories obtained using the standard, in-person, medical survey and show FST is poorly predictive of skin-tone. Finally, we show how noisy estimation of FALM leads to errors selecting explanatory factors for demographic differentials. These results demonstrate that measures of skin-tone for biometric performance evaluations must come from objective, characterized, and controlled sources.

Highly recommend following! <LINK>",https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09291,"The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess whether the construct of neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference; and (2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance - in relation to the ontological and epistemological status of representations - is most appropriate. We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account: an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the aboutness or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.

The 1500 peaks identified depict a continuous sequence spanning almost $2\pi$ in the sky, only obscured when the stream crosses the Galactic disk. Altogether, around $100\,000$ stars potentially belong to the stream as indicated by a coarse inspection of the colour-magnitude diagrams. From these stars, we determine the proper motion along the Sagittarius stream, making it the proper motion sequence with the largest span and continuity ever measured for a stream. A first comparison with existing N-body models of the stream reveals some discrepancies, especially near the pericentre of the trailing arm and an overestimation of the total proper motion for the leading arm. Our study can be the starting point for determining the variation of the population of stars along the stream, the distance to the stream with red clump stars, and the solar motion.

In this paper, we describe a more direct framework for constructing NNS data structures for general norms. More specifically, we show via an algorithmic reduction that an efficient NNS data structure for a given metric is implied by an efficient average distortion embedding of it into $\ell_1$ or into Euclidean space. In particular, the resulting data structures require only polynomial pre-processing time, as long as the embedding can be computed in polynomial time. As a concrete instantiation of this framework, we give an NNS data structure for $\ell_p$ with efficient pre-processing that matches the approximation factor, space and query complexity of the aforementioned data structure of Andoni et al.

We demonstrate the error estimator for an umbrella sampling calculation of the alanine dipeptide in two dimensions and an alchemical calculation of the hydration free energy of methane. In both cases, the states' individual contributions to the error provide insight into the sources of error of the simulations. Our numerical results demonstrate that the time required for the Markov chain to decorrelate in individual thermodynamic states contributes considerably to the total MBAR error.

Cost-Efficient Interference in the Spatial Ultimatum Game",https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03461,"Institutions and investors face the constant challenge of making accurate decisions and predictions regarding how best they should distribute their endowments. The problem of achieving an optimal outcome at minimal cost has been extensively studied and resolved using several heuristics. However, these works usually fail to address how an external party can target different types of fair behaviour or do not take into account how limited information can shape this complex interplay. Here, we consider the well-known Ultimatum game in a spatial setting and propose a hierarchy of interference mechanisms based on the amount of information available to an external decision-maker and desired standards of fairness. Our analysis reveals that monitoring the population at a macroscopic level requires more strict information gathering in order to obtain an optimal outcome and that local observations can mediate this requirement. Moreover, we identify the conditions which must be met for an individual to be eligible for investment in order to avoid unnecessary spending. We further explore the effects of varying mutation or behavioural exploration rates on the choice of investment strategy and total accumulated costs to the investor. Overall, our analysis provides new insights about efficient heuristics for cost-efficient promotion of fairness in societies. Finally, we discuss the differences between our findings and previous work done on the PD and present our suggestions for promoting fairness as an external decision-maker.

So far, only two dichotomic approaches have been considered, based on either static or dynamical properties of critical quantum systems. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the scaling of the quantum Fisher information for different families of protocols that create a continuous connection between static and dynamical approaches. In particular, we consider fully-connected models, a broad class of quantum critical systems of high experimental relevance. Our analysis unveils the existence of universal precision-scaling regimes.

We present a case study on TRAPPIST-1g, the largest planet in the system, using a new observation together with previous data, to disentangle the atmospheric transmission of the planet from that of the star.

However, these catalogs are altered by selection effects that are difficult to model, that correlate in non trivial ways, and that can lead to contradictory predictions if not taken into account carefully. To address this issue, we have developed a new approach combining parametric Bayesian indirect likelihood (pBIL) techniques and empirical modeling with realistic image simulations that reproduce a large fraction of these selection effects. This allows us to perform a direct comparison between observed and simulated images and to infer robust constraints on model parameters. We use a semi-empirical forward model to generate a distribution of mock galaxies from a set of physical parameters. These galaxies are passed through an image simulator reproducing the instrumental characteristics of any survey and are then extracted in the same way as the observed data. The discrepancy between the simulated and observed data is quantified, and minimized with a custom sampling process based on adaptive Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. Using synthetic data matching most of the properties of a CFHTLS Deep field, we demonstrate the robustness and internal consistency of our approach by inferring the parameters governing the size and luminosity functions and their evolutions for different realistic populations of galaxies. We also compare the results of our approach with those obtained from the classical spectral energy distribution fitting and photometric redshift approach.Our pipeline infers efficiently the luminosity and size distribution and evolution parameters with a very limited number of observables (3 photometric bands).

Recent work suggests that initialization is the key. However, while this direction of research has had some success, focusing on initialization alone appears to be inadequate. In this paper, we take a broader view of training sparse networks and consider the role of regularization, optimization, and architecture choices on sparse models. We propose a simple experimental framework, Same Capacity Sparse vs Dense Comparison (SC-SDC), that allows for a fair comparison of sparse and dense networks. Furthermore, we propose a new measure of gradient flow, Effective Gradient Flow (EGF), that better correlates to performance in sparse networks. Using top-line metrics, SC-SDC and EGF, we show that default choices of optimizers, activation functions and regularizers used for dense networks can disadvantage sparse networks.

Efforts to understand humor have called out links between humor and the foundations of cognition, as well as the importance of humor in social engagement. As such, it is a promising and important subject of study, with relevance for artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Previous computational work on humor has mostly operated at a coarse level of granularity, e.g., predicting whether an entire sentence, paragraph, document, etc., is humorous. As a step toward deep understanding of humor, we seek fine-grained models of attributes that make a given text humorous. Starting from the observation that satirical news headlines tend to resemble serious news headlines, we build and analyze a corpus of satirical headlines paired with nearly identical but serious headlines. The corpus is constructed via Unfun.me, an online game that incentivizes players to make minimal edits to satirical headlines with the goal of making other players believe the results are serious headlines. The edit operations used to successfully remove humor pinpoint the words and concepts that play a key role in making the original, satirical headline funny. Our analysis reveals that the humor tends to reside toward the end of headlines, and primarily in noun phrases, and that most satirical headlines follow a certain logical pattern, which we term false analogy. Overall, this paper deepens our understanding of the syntactic and semantic structure of satirical news headlines and provides insights for building humor-producing systems.

Results from these measurements include maps and angular power spectra from observations of 4.8% of the sky at 95 and 150 GHz, along with the results of internal consistency tests on these data. While the polarized CMB anisotropy from primordial density perturbations is the dominant signal in this region of sky, Galactic dust emission is also detected with high significance; Galactic synchrotron emission is found to be negligible in the SPIDER bands. We employ two independent foreground-removal techniques in order to explore the sensitivity of the cosmological result to the assumptions made by each. The primary method uses a dust template derived from Planck data to subtract the Galactic dust signal. A second approach, employing a joint analysis of SPIDER and Planck data in the harmonic domain, assumes a modified-blackbody model for the spectral energy distribution of the dust with no constraint on its spatial morphology. Using a likelihood that jointly samples the template amplitude and $r$ parameter space, we derive 95% upper limits on the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio from Feldman-Cousins and Bayesian constructions, finding $r<0.11$ and $r<0.19$, respectively. Roughly half the uncertainty in $r$ derives from noise associated with the template subtraction.

No increase in the X-ray emission from SN 1970G is found at later epochs, contrary to previous reports. All five SNe show X-ray luminosities that are of comparable magnitude. We compare the late-time X-ray luminosities of these SNe to those of supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy which are a few hundred years old, and find that when the tentative decline is taken into account, the luminosity of the old SNe studied herein could fall below the luminosity of some of the younger SNRs within a few hundred years.

These allow for efficient and reliable determinations of chaos indicators such as the Maximal Lyapunov characteristic Exponent (MLE) and the Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO). In this paper we lay out the theoretical framework to extend the idea of variational equations to higher order. We explicitly derive the differential equations that govern the evolution of second-order variations in the N-body problem. Going to second order opens the door to new applications, including optimization algorithms that require the first and second derivatives of the solution, like the classical Newton's method. Typically, these methods have faster convergence rates than derivative-free methods. Derivatives are also required for Riemann manifold Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods which provide significantly shorter correlation times than standard methods. Such improved optimization methods can be applied to anything from radial-velocity/transit-timing-variation fitting to spacecraft trajectory optimization to asteroid deflection. We provide an implementation of first and second-order variational equations for the publicly available REBOUND integrator package. Our implementation allows the simultaneous integration of any number of first and second-order variational equations with the high-accuracy IAS15 integrator.

We used archival K2 photometry, archival Hubble Space Telescope spectroscopy, and published radial-velocity measurements of the K-type star. Employing Gaussian processes to fit for rotational modulation of the system flux by the main-sequence star, we recovered the transits of the white dwarf in front of the main-sequence star for the first time. The transits are shallower than would be expected from purely geometric occultations owing to gravitational microlensing during transit, which places an additional constraint on the white-dwarf mass. Our revised mass and radius for the main-sequence star is consistent with single-star evolutionary models given the age and metallicity of the Hyades. However, as noted previously in the literature, the white dwarf is too massive and too hot to be the result of single-star evolution given the age of the Hyades, and may be the product of a merger scenario. We independently estimate the conditions of the system at the time of common envelope that would result in the measured orbital parameters today.

In this paper, we study the $r$-NN problem in the light of fairness. We consider fairness in the sense of equal opportunity: all points that are within distance $r$ from the query should have the same probability to be returned. In the low-dimensional case, this problem was first studied by Hu, Qiao, and Tao (PODS 2014). Locality sensitive hashing (LSH), the theoretically strongest approach to similarity search in high dimensions, does not provide such a fairness guarantee. To address this, we propose efficient data structures for $r$-NN where all points in $S$ that are near $q$ have the same probability to be selected and returned by the query. Specifically, we first propose a black-box approach that, given any LSH scheme, constructs a data structure for uniformly sampling points in the neighborhood of a query. Then, we develop a data structure for fair similarity search under inner product that requires nearly-linear space and exploits locality sensitive filters. The paper concludes with an experimental evaluation that highlights (un)fairness in a recommendation setting on real-world datasets and discusses the inherent unfairness introduced by solving other variants of the problem.

But because the training procedure must be unrolled thousands of times, the meta-objective must be defined with an orders-of-magnitude shorter time horizon than is typical for neural net training. We show that such short-horizon meta-objectives cause a serious bias towards small step sizes, an effect we term short-horizon bias. We introduce a toy problem, a noisy quadratic cost function, on which we analyze short-horizon bias by deriving and comparing the optimal schedules for short and long time horizons.

Such intrinsic behaviors could eventually help the agent solve tasks posed by the environment. We present hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN), a framework to integrate hierarchical value functions, operating at different temporal scales, with intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning. A top-level value function learns a policy over intrinsic goals, and a lower-level function learns a policy over atomic actions to satisfy the given goals. h-DQN allows for flexible goal specifications, such as functions over entities and relations. This provides an efficient space for exploration in complicated environments.

When plasmon resonance is swept through molecular transition frequency an avoided crossing may be observed, which is often regarded as a signature of strong coupling between plasmons and molecules. Such strong coupling is expected to be realized when $2|U|/{\hbar\Gamma}>1$, where $U$ and ${\Gamma}$ are the molecule-plasmon coupling and the spectral width of the optical transition respectively. Because both $U$ and ${\Gamma}$ strongly increase with decreasing distance between a molecule and a plasmonic structure it is not obvious that this condition can be satisfied for any molecule-metal surface distance. In this work we investigate the behavior of $U$ and ${\Gamma}$ for several geometries. Surprisingly, we find that if the only contributions to ${\Gamma}$ are lifetime broadenings associated with the radiative and nonradiative relaxation of a single molecular vibronic transition, including effects on molecular radiative and nonradiative lifetimes induced by the metal, the criterion $2|U|/{\hbar\Gamma}>1$ is easily satisfied by many configurations irrespective of the metal-molecule distance. This implies that the Rabi splitting can be observed in such structures if other sources of broadening are suppressed. Additionally, when the molecule-metal surface distance is varied keeping all other molecular and metal parameters constant, this behavior is mitigated due to the spectral shift associated with the same molecule-plasmon interaction, making the observation of Rabi splitting more challenging.

However, recent works have shown that deep networks can be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, which raised a serious robustness issue of deep networks. Adversarial training, typically formulated as a robust optimization problem, is an effective way of improving the robustness of deep networks. A major drawback of existing adversarial training algorithms is the computational overhead of the generation of adversarial examples, typically far greater than that of the network training. This leads to the unbearable overall computational cost of adversarial training. In this paper, we show that adversarial training can be cast as a discrete time differential game. Through analyzing the Pontryagin's Maximal Principle (PMP) of the problem, we observe that the adversary update is only coupled with the parameters of the first layer of the network. This inspires us to restrict most of the forward and back propagation within the first layer of the network during adversary updates. This effectively reduces the total number of full forward and backward propagation to only one for each group of adversary updates.

This radiation will behave as a line interloper for the atomic and molecular spectral lines targeted by LIM surveys. The most distinctive signatures of the contribution from dark-matter radiative decays are an extra anisotropy on the LIM power spectrum due to projection effects, as well as a narrowing and a shift towards higher intensities of the voxel intensity distribution. We forecast the minimum rate of decays into two photons that LIM surveys will be sensitive to as function of the dark-matter mass in the range $\sim 10^{-6}-10$ eV, and discuss how to reinterpret such results for dark matter that decays into a photon and another particle. We find that both the power spectrum and the voxel intensity distribution are expected to be very sensitive to the dark-matter contribution, with the voxel intensity distribution being more promising for most experiments considered. Interpreting our results in terms of the axion, we show that LIM surveys will be extremely competitive to detect its decay products, improving several orders of magnitudes (depending on the mass) the sensitivity of laboratory and astrophysical searches, especially in the mass range $\sim 1-10$ eV.

Here, we demonstrate how ion irradiation can be used to tailor disorder in initially crystalline Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) thin films via the intentional creation of lattice defects. We found that continuous Ar ion irradiation at room temperature of GST films causes complete amorphization of GST when exceeding 0.6 (for rock-salt GST) and 3 (for hexagonal GST) displacements per atom (n_dpa). While the transition from rock-salt to amorphous GST is caused by progressive amorphization via the accumulation of lattice defects, several transitions occur in hexagonal GST upon ion irradiation. In hexagonal GST, the creation of point defects and small defect clusters leads to disordering of intrinsic vacancy layers (van der Waals gaps) that drives the electronic metal-insulator transition. Increasing disorder then induces a structural transition from hexagonal to rock-salt and then leads to amorphization. Furthermore, we observed different annealing behavior of defects for rock-salt and hexagonal GST. The higher amorphization threshold in hexagonal GST compared to rock-salt GST is caused by an increased defect-annealing rate, i.e., a higher resistance against ion-beam-induced disorder. Moreover, we observed that the recovery of defects in GST is on the time scale of seconds or less at room temperature. ","Fast recovery of ion-irradiation-induced defects in Ge2Sb2Te5 thin films

They indicate that there can be major differences in the epidemic size and epidemic probabilities which are equivalent in the normal SIR processes. Further, degree heterogeneity is seen to be especially important for the epidemic threshold but not as much for the epidemic size. The probability that tracing leads to quarantines is not as important as the application adoption rate.

Here, we devise a means of separating 'good' from 'bad' astrometric solutions that is an order of magnitude cleaner than any single flag: 99.3% pure and 97.3% complete, as validated on our test data. We devise an extensive sample of manifestly bad astrometric solutions, with parallax that is negative at > 4.5 sigma; and a corresponding sample of presumably good solutions, including sources in HEALPix pixels on the sky that do not contain such negative parallaxes, and sources that fall on the main sequence in a color-absolute magnitude diagram. We then train a neural network that uses 17 pertinent Gaia catalog entries and information about nearby sources to discriminate between these two samples, captured in a single 'astrometric fidelity' parameter. A diverse set of verification tests shows that our approach works very cleanly, including for sources with positive parallaxes.

While many domain adaptation techniques have been proposed for images, the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation in videos remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Contrast and Mix (CoMix), a new contrastive learning framework that aims to learn discriminative invariant feature representations for unsupervised video domain adaptation. First, unlike existing methods that rely on adversarial learning for feature alignment, we utilize temporal contrastive learning to bridge the domain gap by maximizing the similarity between encoded representations of an unlabeled video at two different speeds as well as minimizing the similarity between different videos played at different speeds. Second, we propose a novel extension to the temporal contrastive loss by using background mixing that allows additional positives per anchor, thus adapting contrastive learning to leverage action semantics shared across both domains. Moreover, we also integrate a supervised contrastive learning objective using target pseudo-labels to enhance discriminability of the latent space for video domain adaptation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.

The sceptical Bayes factor is the highest level where replication success can be declared. A comparison to existing methods reveals that the sceptical Bayes factor combines several notions of replicability: it ensures that both studies show sufficient evidence against the null and penalises incompatibility of their effect estimates.

On average the black holes increase their initial mass by a factor 10$^{-5}$, with the most active black holes increasing their mass by approximately 10%. Only a single black hole experiences any period of super-Eddington accretion, but the duration is very short and not repeated. Furthermore, we find no correlation of black hole accretion with halo mass in the mass range sampled. Within most haloes, we identify clumps of cool, dense gas for which accretion rates would be high, but instances of black holes encountering these clumps are rare and short-lived. Star formation competes with black hole growth by consuming available gas and driving down accretion rates through feedback.

Under these assumptions there are traditional tools for inferring potential parameters given observations of stellar kinematics (e.g., Jeans models). However, spectroscopic surveys measure many stellar properties beyond kinematics. Here we present a new approach for dynamical inference, Orbital Torus Imaging, which makes use of kinematic measurements and element abundances (or other invariant labels). We exploit the fact that, in steady state, stellar labels vary systematically with orbit characteristics (actions), yet must be invariant with respect to orbital phases (conjugate angles). The orbital foliation of phase space must therefore coincide with surfaces along which all moments of all stellar label distributions are constant. Both classical-statistics and Bayesian methods can be built on this; these methods will be more robust and require fewer assumptions than traditional tools because they require no knowledge of the (spatial) survey selection function and they do not involve second moments of velocity distributions. We perform a classical-statistics demonstration with red giant branch stars from the APOGEE surveys: We model the vertical orbit structure in the Milky Way disk to constrain the local disk mass, scale height, and the disk--halo mass ratio (at fixed local circular velocity). We find that the disk mass can be constrained (na\""ively) at the few-percent level with Orbital Torus Imaging using only eight element-abundance ratios, demonstrating the promise of combining stellar labels with dynamical invariants.

Here, we outline some possible ways of thinking about this problem, starting from the suggestion that modelers need to keep the right end goal in sight: A successful human-robot interaction, in terms of safety, performance, and human satisfaction. Efforts toward model completeness and accuracy should be focused on those aspects of human behavior to which interaction success is most sensitive. We emphasise that identifying which those aspects are is a difficult scientific objective in its own right, distinct for each given HRI context. We propose and exemplify an approach to formulating a priori hypotheses on this matter, in cases where robots are to be involved in interactions which currently take place between humans, such as in automated driving.

On multi-project citizen science platforms, scientists can create projects consisting of tasks. Volunteers, in turn, participate in executing the project's tasks. Such type of platforms seeks to connect volunteers and scientists' projects, adding value to both. However, little is known about volunteer's cross-project engagement patterns and the benefits of such patterns for scientists and volunteers. This work proposes a Goal, Question, and Metric (GQM) approach to analyse volunteers' cross-project task execution patterns and employs the Semiotic Inspection Method (SIM) to analyse the communicability of the platform's cross-project features. In doing so, it investigates what are the features of platforms to foster volunteers' cross-project engagement, to what extent multi-project platforms facilitate the attraction of volunteers to perform tasks in new projects, and to what extent multi-project participation increases engagement on the platforms. Results from analyses on real platforms show that volunteers tend to explore multiple projects, but they perform tasks regularly in just a few of them; few projects attract much attention from volunteers; volunteers recruited from other projects on the platform tend to get more engaged than those recruited outside the platform. System inspection shows that platforms still lack personalised and explainable recommendations of projects and tasks.

Here we present new convective models able to produce long-lived polar vortices. Using simulation parameters relevant for giant planet atmospheres we find flow regimes that are in agreement with geostrophic turbulence (GT) theory in rotating convection for the formation of large scale coherent structures via an upscale energy transfer fully three-dimensional. Our simulations generate polar characteristics qualitatively similar to those seen by Juno and Cassini: they match the structure of cyclonic vortices seen on Jupiter; or can account for the existence of a strong polar vortex extending downwards to lower latitudes with a marked spiral morphology and the hexagonal pattern seen on Saturn. Our findings indicate that these vortices can be generated deep in the planetary interior. A transition differentiating these two polar flows regimes is described, interpreted in terms of different force balances and compared with previous shallow atmospheric models which characterised polar vortex dynamics in giant planets.

Given a stream of k-bit words, we seek to compute k distinct sums corresponding to bit values at indexes 0, 1, 2, ..., k-1. If the k-bit words are one-hot encoded then the sums correspond to a frequency histogram. This multiple-sum problem is a generalization of the population-count problem where we seek the sum of all bit values.

Various mathematical formulations of fairness have been proposed, and it has been shown that it is impossible to satisfy all of them simultaneously. The literature so far has dealt with these impossibility results by quantifying the tradeoffs between different formulations of fairness. Our work takes a different perspective on this issue. Rather than requiring all notions of fairness to (partially) hold at the same time, we ask which one of them is the most appropriate given the societal domain in which the decision-making model is to be deployed. We take a descriptive approach and set out to identify the notion of fairness that best captures \emph{lay people's perception of fairness}. We run adaptive experiments designed to pinpoint the most compatible notion of fairness with each participant's choices through a small number of tests. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the most simplistic mathematical definition of fairness---namely, demographic parity---most closely matches people's idea of fairness in two distinct application scenarios. This conclusion remains intact even when we explicitly tell the participants about the alternative, more complicated definitions of fairness, and we reduce the cognitive burden of evaluating those notions for them.

Forthcoming 21cm intensity mapping experiments will aim to probe these scales by surveying neutral hydrogen (HI) within galaxies. However, foreground signals dominate the faint 21cm emission, meaning foreground cleaning is required to recover the cosmological signal. The effect this has is to damp the HI power spectrum on the largest scales, especially along the line-of-sight. Whilst there is agreement that this contamination is potentially problematic for probing PNG, it is yet to be fully explored and quantified. In this work we carry out the first forecasts on $f_\text{NL}$ that incorporate simulated foreground maps that are removed using techniques employed in real data. Using an MCMC analysis, we demonstrate that foreground cleaned data recovers hugely biased values ($f_\text{NL} = -102.1_{-7.96}^{+8.39}$ [68% CL]) on our $f_\text{NL}=0$ fiducial input. Introducing a model with fixed parameters for the foreground contamination allows us to recover unbiased results ($f_\text{NL} = -2.94_{-11.9}^{+11.4}$). However, it is not clear that we will have sufficient understanding of foreground contamination to allow for such rigid models. Treating the main parameter $k_\parallel^\text{FG}$ in our foreground model as a nuisance parameter and marginalizing over it, still recovers unbiased results but at the expense of much larger errors ($f_\text{NL} = 0.75^{+40.2}_{-44.5}$), that can only be reduced by imposing the Planck 2018 prior.

This paper investigates whether independent reinforcement learning (RL) agents in a multi-agent environment can learn to use social learning to improve their performance. We find that in most circumstances, vanilla model-free RL agents do not use social learning. We analyze the reasons for this deficiency, and show that by imposing constraints on the training environment and introducing a model-based auxiliary loss we are able to obtain generalized social learning policies which enable agents to: i) discover complex skills that are not learned from single-agent training, and ii) adapt online to novel environments by taking cues from experts present in the new environment. In contrast, agents trained with model-free RL or imitation learning generalize poorly and do not succeed in the transfer tasks. By mixing multi-agent and solo training, we can obtain agents that use social learning to gain skills that they can deploy when alone, even out-performing agents trained alone from the start.

Specifically, we are interested training models that are more robust to noise distributions not present in the training data. We find that a learned optimizer meta-trained to produce models which are robust to Gaussian noise trains models that are more robust to Gaussian noise at other scales compared to traditional optimizers like Adam.

We search for close stellar encounters to the Sun among all 7.2 million stars in Gaia-DR2 that have six-dimensional phase space data. We characterize encounters by integrating their orbits through a Galactic potential and propagating the correlated uncertainties via a Monte Carlo resampling. After filtering to remove spurious data, we find 694 stars that have median (over uncertainties) closest encounter distances within 5 pc, all occurring within 15 Myr from now. 26 of these have at least a 50% chance of coming closer than 1 pc (and 7 within 0.5 pc), all but one of which are newly discovered here. We further confirm some and refute several other previously-identified encounters, confirming suspicions about their data. The closest encounter in the sample is Gl 710, which has a 95% probability of coming closer than 0.08 pc (17 000 AU). Taking mass estimates from Gaia astrometry and multiband photometry for essentially all encounters, we find that Gl 710 also has the largest impulse on the Oort cloud. Using a Galaxy model, we compute the completeness of the Gaia-DR2 encountering sample as a function of perihelion time and distance. Only 15% of encounters within 5 pc occurring within +/- 5 Myr of now have been identified, mostly due to the lack of radial velocities for faint and/or cool stars. Accounting for the incompleteness, we infer the present rate of encounters within 1 pc to be 19.7 +/- 2.2 per Myr, a quantity expected to scale quadratically with the encounter distance out to at least several pc.

Also, DiCENet generalizes better to tasks (e.g., object detection) that are often used in resource-constrained devices in comparison to state-of-the-art separable convolution-based efficient networks, including neural search-based methods (e.g., MobileNetv3 and MixNet.

By adapting a prior agent-based model of cell interactions on the fish body, we present an in silico study of stripe development on tailfins.

We systematically study the universality of mass functions over a wide range of mass definitions, for the first time including the recently proposed splashback mass, Msp. We confirm that, in LambdaCDM cosmologies, all mass definitions exhibit varying levels of non-universality that increase with peak height and reach between 20% and 500% at the highest masses we can test. Mvir, M200m, and Msp exhibit similar levels of non-universality. There are, however, two regimes where the splashback mass functions are significantly more universal. First, they are universal to 10% at z<2, whereas spherical overdensity definitions experience an evolution due to dark energy. Second, when additionally considering self-similar cosmologies with extreme power spectra, splashback mass functions are remarkably universal (to between 40% and 60%) whereas their spherical overdensity counterparts reach non-universalities between 180% and 450%.

The total amount of unbound mass ejected ($0.013M_\odot$, or $\simeq 40\%$ of the initial torus mass) is twice as much as in hydrodynamic models, with higher average velocity ($0.1c$) and a broad electron fraction distribution with a lower average value ($0.16$).

The primary questions pondered here are: under what loading conditions, if any, can bifurcation into circumferential buckling modes occur, and do such solutions dominate localisation and periodic axial modes? Three distinct boundary conditions are considered; in case 1 the tube's curved surfaces are traction free and under surface tension, whilst in cases 2 and 3 the inner and outer surfaces (respectively) are fixed to prevent radial displacement and surface tension. A linear bifurcation analysis is conducted to determine numerically the existence of circumferential mode solutions. In case 1 we focus on the tensile stress regime given the preference of slender compressed tubes towards Euler buckling over axial wrinkling. We show that tubes under several loading paths are highly sensitive to circumferential modes; in contrast, localised and periodic axial modes are absent, suggesting that the circumferential buckling is dominant by default. In case 2, circumferential mode solutions are associated with negative surface tension values and thus are physically implausible.

Much of the growth of these protocols has been driven by incentivized pools or 'yield farming', which reward participants in crypto assets for providing liquidity to CFMMs. As a result, CFMMs and associated protocols, which were historically very small markets, now constitute the most liquid trading venues for a large number of crypto assets. But what does it mean for a CFMM to be the most liquid market? In this paper, we propose a basic definition of price sensitivity and liquidity. We show that this definition is tightly related to the curvature of a CFMM's trading function and can be used to explain a number of heuristic results. For example, we show that low-curvature markets are good for coins whose market value is approximately fixed and that high-curvature markets are better for liquidity providers when traders have an informational edge. Additionally, the results can also be used to model interacting markets and explain the rise of incentivized liquidity provision, also known as 'yield farming.' ",When does the tail wag the dog?

The work hinges on a key result that there exist spectral features related to a finite domain of the Gaussian process which exhibit almost-independent covariances.

Research in this area has focused primarily on variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), and several proposals to enhance supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms with VQAs have been put forward. Out of the three, RL is the least studied and it is still an open question whether VQAs can be competitive with state-of-the-art classical algorithms based on neural networks (NNs) even on simple benchmark tasks. In this work, we introduce a training method for parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) that can be used to solve RL tasks for discrete and continuous state spaces based on the deep Q-learning algorithm. We investigate which architectural choices for quantum Q-learning agents are most important for successfully solving certain types of environments by performing ablation studies for a number of different data encoding and readout strategies. We provide insight into why the performance of a VQA-based Q-learning algorithm crucially depends on the observables of the quantum model and show how to choose suitable observables based on the learning task at hand. To compare our model against the classical DQN algorithm, we perform an extensive hyperparameter search of PQCs and NNs with varying numbers of parameters. We confirm that similar to results in classical literature, the architectural choices and hyperparameters contribute more to the agents' success in a RL setting than the number of parameters used in the model. Finally, we show when recent separation results between classical and quantum agents for policy gradient RL can be extended to inferring optimal Q-values in restricted families of environments.

To tackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation method. This technique rigorously describes the full thermodyamics of crystals accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. The approach requires the evaluation of the Born-Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives with respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in supercells, which can be provided, for instance, by first principles density-functional-theory codes. The method performs crystal geometry relaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free energy with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used to determine the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables the calculation of phase boundaries for both first-order and second-order phase transitions from the Hessian of the free energy. Finally, the code can also compute the anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well as phonon spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation and its dynamical extension, making particular emphasis on the physical interpretation of the variables present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with any other anharmonic theory.

The median age of thick-disc stars at $z=0$ correlates strongly with this transition time. We also find that galaxies with an earlier transition from bursty to steady star formation have a higher thin-disc fractions at $z=0$.

As a result, companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Naver offer highly accurate commercial face recognition web services for diverse applications to meet the end-user needs. Naturally, however, such technologies are threatened persistently, as virtually any individual can quickly implement impersonation attacks. In particular, these attacks can be a significant threat for authentication and identification services, which heavily rely on their underlying face recognition technologies' accuracy and robustness. Despite its gravity, the issue regarding deepfake abuse using commercial web APIs and their robustness has not yet been thoroughly investigated. This work provides a measurement study on the robustness of black-box commercial face recognition APIs against Deepfake Impersonation (DI) attacks using celebrity recognition APIs as an example case study. We use five deepfake datasets, two of which are created by us and planned to be released. More specifically, we measure attack performance based on two scenarios (targeted and non-targeted) and further analyze the differing system behaviors using fidelity, confidence, and similarity metrics. Accordingly, we demonstrate how vulnerable face recognition technologies from popular companies are to DI attack, achieving maximum success rates of 78.0% and 99.9% for targeted (i.e., precise match) and non-targeted (i.e., match with any celebrity) attacks, respectively. Moreover, we propose practical defense strategies to mitigate DI attacks, reducing the attack success rates to as low as 0% and 0.02% for targeted and non-targeted attacks, respectively.

In experiments, measurements yield much richer information - e.g., continuous current values, discrete photon counts - which is then mapped into binary outcomes by discarding some of this information. In this work, we consider methods to incorporate all of this richer information, typically called soft information, into the decoding of quantum error correction codes, and in particular the surface code. We describe how to modify both the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching and Union-Find decoders to leverage soft information, and demonstrate these soft decoders outperform the standard (hard) decoders that can only access the binary measurement outcomes. Moreover, we observe that the soft decoder achieves a threshold 25\% higher than any hard decoder for phenomenological noise with Gaussian soft measurement outcomes. We also introduce a soft measurement error model with amplitude damping, in which measurement time leads to a trade-off between measurement resolution and additional disturbance of the qubits. Under this model we observe that the performance of the surface code is very sensitive to the choice of the measurement time - for a distance-19 surface code, a five-fold increase in measurement time can lead to a thousand-fold increase in logical error rate. Moreover, the measurement time that minimizes the physical error rate is distinct from the one that minimizes the logical performance, pointing to the benefits of jointly optimizing the physical and quantum error correction layers.

Here we evaluate how the atmospheres of these planets respond to irradiation by stars of different spectral type. We find that ultra-hot Jupiters exhibit temperature inversions that are sensitive to the spectral type of the host star. The slope and temperature range across the inversion both increase as the host star effective temperature increases due to enhanced absorption at short wavelengths and low pressures. The steep temperature inversions in ultra-hot Jupiters around hot stars result in increased thermal dissociation and ionization compared to similar planets around cooler stars. The resulting increase in H$^{-}$ opacity leads to a transit spectrum that has muted absorption features. The emission spectrum, however, exhibits a large contrast in brightness temperature, a signature that will be detectable with both secondary eclipse observations and high-dispersion spectroscopy. We also find that the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium in the stellar atmosphere can affect the degree of heating caused by atomic metals in the planet's upper atmosphere.

For 62 cities we study different variations of growing a synthetic bicycle network between an arbitrary set of points routed on the urban street network. We find initially decreasing returns on investment until a critical threshold, posing fundamental consequences to sustainable urban planning: Cities must invest into bicycle networks with the right growth strategy, and persistently, to surpass a critical mass. We also find pronounced overlaps of synthetically grown networks in cities with well-developed existing bicycle networks, showing that our model reflects reality. Growing networks from scratch makes our approach a generally applicable starting point for sustainable urban bicycle network planning with minimal data requirements.

Our survey is designed to obtain well-sampled $griz$ light curves for thousands of transient events up to $z \approx 0.2$. This large sample of transients with 4-band light curves will lay the foundation for the Vera C.

As the name suggests, YSE complements and extends other ongoing time-domain surveys by discovering fast-rising SNe within a few hours to days of explosion. YSE is the only current four-band time-domain survey and is able to discover transients as faint $\sim$21.5 mag in $gri$ and $\sim$20.5 mag in $z$, depths that allow us to probe the earliest epochs of stellar explosions. YSE is currently observing approximately 750 square degrees of sky every three days and we plan to increase the area to 1500 square degrees in the near future. When operating at full capacity, survey simulations show that YSE will find $\sim$5000 new SNe per year and at least two SNe within three days of explosion per month.

Moreover, it justifies the operational interpretation of most entropic quantities. In this work, we revisit the notion of contraction coefficients of quantum channels, which provide sharper and specialized versions of the data processing inequality. A concept closely related to data processing is partial orders on quantum channels. First, we discuss several quantum extensions of the well-known less noisy ordering and relate them to contraction coefficients. We further define approximate versions of the partial orders and show how they can give strengthened and conceptually simple proofs of several results on approximating capacities. Moreover, we investigate the relation to other partial orders in the literature and their properties, particularly with regards to tensorization.

One approach for leveraging prior knowledge is to transfer skills learned on prior tasks to the new task. However, as the amount of prior experience increases, the number of transferable skills grows too, making it challenging to explore the full set of available skills during downstream learning. Yet, intuitively, not all skills should be explored with equal probability; for example information about the current state can hint which skills are promising to explore. In this work, we propose to implement this intuition by learning a prior over skills. We propose a deep latent variable model that jointly learns an embedding space of skills and the skill prior from offline agent experience. We then extend common maximum-entropy RL approaches to use skill priors to guide downstream learning.

We condition neural response generators on the action plan which is then realized as target utterances at the turn and sentence levels. We also investigate different dialogue policy models to predict an action plan given the dialogue context. Through automated and human evaluation, we measure the appropriateness of the generated responses and check if the generation models indeed learn to realize the given action plans.

Fitted MM can be used to perform image synthesis ! <LINK>,https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10629,"Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised clustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology of the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points similarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior probability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing probabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or more complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these approaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to complicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of the Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of over-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule for the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a special case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share class information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to artificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative and qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t mixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to propagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural networks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation for feedback signals in biological visual systems.

HD13724 is a nearby solar-type star at 43.48 $\pm$ 0.06 pc hosting a long-period low-mass brown dwarf detected with the CORALIE echelle spectrograph as part of the historical CORALIE radial-velocity search for extra-solar planets. The companion has a minimum mass of $26.77^{+4.4}_{-2.2} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$ and an expected semi-major axis of $\sim$ 240 mas making it a suitable target for further characterisation with high-contrast imaging, in particular to measure its inclination, mass, and spectrum and thus establish its substellar nature. Aims. Using high-contrast imaging with the SPHERE instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), we are able to directly image a brown dwarf companion to HD13724 and obtain a low-resolution spectrum. Methods. We combine the radial-velocity measurements of CORALIE and HARPS taken over two decades and high contrast imaging from SPHERE to obtain a dynamical mass estimate. From the SPHERE data we obtain a low resolution spectrum of the companion from Y to J band, as well as photometric measurements from IRDIS in the J, H and K bands. Results. Using high-contrast imaging with the SPHERE instrument at the VLT, we report the first images of a brown dwarf companion to the host star HD13724. It has an angular separation of 175.6 $\pm$ 4.5 mas and H-band contrast of $10.61\pm0.16$ mag and, using the age estimate of the star to be $\sim$1 Gyr, gives an isochronal mass estimate of $\sim$44 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. By combining radial-velocity and imaging data we also obtain a dynamical mass of $50.5^{+3.3}_{-3.5} M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$. Through fitting an atmospheric model, we estimate a surface gravity of $\log g = 5.5$ and an effective temperature of 1000K. A comparison of its spectrum with observed T dwarfs estimates a spectral type of T4 or T4.5, with a T4 object providing the best fit.

Interest is also increasing in automated ML packages, which can make it easier for non-experts to apply ML and have the potential to improve model performance. ML permeates most subfields of biomedical research with varying levels of rigor and correct usage. Tremendous opportunities offered by ML are frequently offset by the challenge of assembling comprehensive analysis pipelines, and the ease of ML misuse. In this work we have laid out and assembled a complete, rigorous ML analysis pipeline focused on binary classification (i.e. case/control prediction), and applied this pipeline to both simulated and real world data. At a high level, this 'automated' but customizable pipeline includes a) exploratory analysis, b) data cleaning and transformation, c) feature selection, d) model training with 9 established ML algorithms, each with hyperparameter optimization, and e) thorough evaluation, including appropriate metrics, statistical analyses, and novel visualizations. This pipeline organizes the many subtle complexities of ML pipeline assembly to illustrate best practices to avoid bias and ensure reproducibility. Additionally, this pipeline is the first to compare established ML algorithms to 'ExSTraCS', a rule-based ML algorithm with the unique capability of interpretably modeling heterogeneous patterns of association.

One particular way of tackling this is grounded in an algorithmic description of life: living organisms can be seen as systems that extract and process information from their surroundings in order to reduce uncertainty. Here we take this computational approach using a simple bit string model of coevolving agents and their parasites. While agents try to predict their worlds, parasites do the same with their hosts. The result of this process is that, in order to escape their parasites, the host agents expand their computational complexity despite the cost of maintaining it. This, in turn, is followed by increasingly complex parasitic counterparts. Such arms races display several qualitative phases, from monotonous to punctuated evolution or even ecological collapse. Our minimal model illustrates the relevance of parasites in providing an active mechanism for expanding living complexity beyond simple replicators, suggesting that parasitic agents are likely to be a major evolutionary driver for biological complexity.

By testing our method on mock data stellar streams, with realistic phase-space dispersions and Gaia uncertainties, we demonstrate that it is applicable to small streams out to a distance of a few kilo-parsec, and that the surface density of the disk can be determined to a precision of 6 %. This method is complementary to other mass measurements. In particular, it does not rely on any equilibrium assumption for stars in the Galactic disk, and also makes it possible to measure the surface density to good precision at large distances from the Sun.

One possible choice is the map based on Fisher information introduced by Huangjun Zhu, known to be an order morphism taking values in the cone of positive semidefinite matrices.

For this purpose, we employ Grassmannian diffusion maps, a two-step nonlinear dimension reduction technique which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify meaningful geometric descriptions in a parsimonious and inexpensive manner. Polynomial chaos expansion is then used to construct a mapping between the stochastic input parameters and the diffusion coordinates of the reduced space. An adaptive clustering technique is proposed to identify an optimal number of clusters of points in the latent space. The similarity of points allows us to construct a number of geometric harmonic emulators which are finally utilized as a set of inexpensive pre-trained models to perform an inverse map of realizations of latent features to the ambient space and thus perform accurate out-of-sample predictions. Thus, the proposed method acts as an encoder-decoder system which is able to automatically handle very high-dimensional data while simultaneously operating successfully in the small-data regime. The method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems and on a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations which model a first-order chemical reaction between two species.

We investigate the influence of outgassing of various species and escape of H$_2$ for different mantle redox states upon the composition and evolution of the atmosphere for the magma ocean period. We include an important new atmosphere-interior coupling mechanism namely the redox evolution of the mantle which strongly affects the outgassing of species. We simulate the volatile outgassing and chemical speciation at the surface for various redox states of the mantle by employing a C-H-O based chemical speciation model combined with an interior outgassing model. We then apply a line-by-line radiative transfer model to study the remote appearance of the planet in terms of the infrared emission and transmission. Finally, we use a parameterized diffusion-limited and XUV energy-driven atmospheric escape model to calculate the loss of H$_2$ to space. We have simulated the thermal emission and transmission spectra for reduced or oxidized atmospheres present during the magma ocean period of Earth. Reduced or thin atmospheres consisting of H$_2$ in abundance emit more radiation to space and have larger effective height as compared to oxidized or thick atmospheres which are abundant in H$_2$O and CO$_2$. We obtain the outgassing rates of H2 from the mantle into the atmosphere to be a factor of ten times larger than the rates of diffusion-limited escape to space.

Both planets are validated and characterized via ground-based follow-up observations. HARPS RV monitoring yields 97.7 percentile mass upper limits of 0.35 $M_\oplus$ and 1.4 $M_\oplus$ for planets b and c, respectively. The astrometric companion detected by the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m has an orbital period on the order of decades and is undetected by other means. Additional ground-based observations constrain the companion to being a high-mass brown dwarf or smaller. Each planet is of unique interest; the inner planet has an ultra-short period, and the outer planet is in the Venus zone. Both are promising targets for atmospheric characterization with the JWST and mass measurements via extreme-precision radial velocity. A third planet candidate of radius 0.9$\pm$0.1 $R_\oplus$ in a 4.97-day orbit is also identified in multi-Cycle TESS data for validation in future work. The host star is associated with an observed gap in the lower main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

We draw parallels to the study of evolvable genomes in evolutionary systems -- genomes with a strong capacity to adapt -- and propose that meta-learning and adaptive evolvability optimize for the same objective: high performance after a set of learning iterations. We argue that population-based evolutionary systems with non-static fitness landscapes naturally bias towards high-evolvability genomes, and therefore optimize for populations with strong learning ability. We demonstrate this claim with a simple evolutionary algorithm, Population-Based Meta Learning (PBML), that consistently discovers genomes which display higher rates of improvement over generations, and can rapidly adapt to solve sparse fitness and robotic control tasks.

Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble $\{p_i,| \psi_i \rangle\}$, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density matrix $\overline{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$. We first show that $\overline{\rho}$ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with $\overline{\rho}$, and hence $\overline{\rho}$ can always be interpreted as a covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called ""PCA without centering"", which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of standard PCA.

The observed and apparent RV variations show contributions, respectively, from the binary motion as well as from a large spot group on one of the stars, presumed to be the primary. Fitting and removing the orbital signal from the RVs, we found the lower bound on the lifetime of a previously identified large spot group on the surface of the star to be at least 5.1 years. A $\sim5$ year lower limit is a long, but not unprecedented, duration for a single spot group. The later epoch data indicate significant spot evolution has occurred, placing an upper bound on the spot group lifetime at 12 years. We find that pre-main sequence evolutionary models for the age of Taurus ($\sim2$ Myr), combined with component mass estimates from the literature, permit us to reproduce the HST relative photometry and the binary-induced contribution to the apparent RV variations. The long-lived star spot we find on Hubble 4 has significant implications for dynamo models in young stars, as it adds evidence for long lifetimes of magnetic field topologies.

In many applications, the PDE cannot be solved analytically. We can only evaluate an approximation of the exact PDE solution. Therefore, the probability of rare events is estimated with respect to an approximation of the limit-state function. This leads to an approximation error in the estimate of the probability of rare events. Indeed, we prove an error bound for the approximation error of the probability of failure, which behaves like the discretization accuracy of the PDE multiplied by an approximation of the probability of failure, the first order reliability method (FORM) estimate. This bound requires convexity of the failure domain. For non-convex failure domains, we prove an error bound for the relative error of the FORM estimate.

In SL, the likelihood function of the data is replaced by a multivariate Gaussian density over summary statistics of the data. SL requires simulation of many replicate datasets at every parameter value considered by a sampling algorithm, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), making the method computationally-intensive. We propose two strategies to alleviate the computational burden. First, we introduce an algorithm producing a proposal distribution that is sequentially tuned and made conditional to data, thus it rapidly \textit{guides} the proposed parameters towards high posterior density regions. In our experiments, a small number of iterations of our algorithm is enough to rapidly locate high density regions, which we use to initialize one or several chains that make use of off-the-shelf adaptive MCMC methods. Our ""guided"" approach can also be potentially used with MCMC samplers for approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Second, we exploit strategies borrowed from the correlated pseudo-marginal MCMC literature, to improve the chains mixing in a SL framework. Moreover, our methods enable inference for challenging case studies, when the posterior is multimodal and when the chain is initialised in low posterior probability regions of the parameter space, where standard samplers failed.

In fact, in recent years several studies have found a convergence of issues related to the ethics and transparency of these systems in the process of data collection and how they are recorded. Although the process of rigorous data collection and analysis is fundamental in the model design, this step is still largely overlooked by the machine learning community.

To address this, we investigate non-deterministic rewriting systems (multiway systems) of the Wolfram model. We express these rewriting systems as homotopy types. Using this new formulation, we outline how spatial structures can be functorially inherited from pregeometric type-theoretic constructions. We show how higher homotopy types are constructed from rewriting rules. These correspond to morphisms of an $n$-fold category. Subsequently, the $n \to \infty$ limit of the Wolfram model rulial multiway system is identified as an $\infty$-groupoid, with the latter being relevant given Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis. We then go on to show how this construction extends to the classifying space of rulial multiway systems, which forms a multiverse of multiway systems and carries the formal structure of an ${\left(\infty, 1\right)}$-topos. This correspondence to higher categorical structures offers a new way to understand how spaces relevant to physics may arise from pregeometric combinatorial models. A key issue we have addressed here is to relate abstract non-deterministic rewriting systems to higher homotopy spaces. A consequence of constructing spaces and geometry synthetically is that it eliminates ad hoc assumptions about geometric attributes of a model such as an a priori background or pre-assigned geometric data. Instead, geometry is inherited functorially by higher structures. This is relevant for formally justifying different choices of underlying spacetime discretization adopted by models of quantum gravity.

We propose to extend current learning-based image registration to allow simultaneous registration of multiple images. To achieve this, we build upon the pair-wise variational and diffeomorphic VoxelMorph approach and present a general mathematical framework that enables both registration of multiple images to their geodesic average and registration in which any of the available images can be used as a fixed image. In addition, we provide a likelihood based on normalized mutual information, a well-known image similarity metric in registration, between multiple images, and a prior that allows for explicit control over the viscous fluid energy to effectively regularize deformations. We trained and evaluated our approach using intra-patient registration of breast MRI and Thoracic 4DCT exams acquired over multiple time points. Comparison with Elastix and VoxelMorph demonstrates competitive quantitative performance of the proposed method in terms of image similarity and reference landmark distances at significantly faster registration.

Many SNe Ic-bl have been observed in coincidence with long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) which suggests a connection between SNe and GRBs. A small fraction of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) form a rapidly-rotating and strongly-magnetized protoneutron star (PNS), a proto-magnetar. Jets from such magnetars can provide the high kinetic energies observed in SNe Ic-bl and also provide the connection to GRBs. In this work we use the jetted outflow produced in a 3D CCSN simulation from a consistently formed proto-magnetar as the central engine for full-star explosion simulations. We extract a range of central engine parameters and find that the extracted engine energy is in the range of $6.231 \times 10^{51}-1.725 \times 10^{52}$ erg, the engine time-scale in the range of $0.479-1.159$ s and the engine half-opening angle in the range of $\sim 9-19^{\circ}$. Using these as central engines, we perform 2D special-relativistic (SR) hydrodynamic (HD) and radiation transfer simulations to calculate the corresponding light curves and spectra. We find that these central engine parameters successfully produce SNe Ic-bl which demonstrates that jets from proto-magnetars can be viable engines for SNe Ic-bl. We also find that only the central engines with smaller opening angles ($\sim 10^{\circ}$) form a GRB implying that GRB formation is likely associated with narrower jet outflows and Ic-bl's without GRBs may be associated with wider outflows.

Measurements of the dust mass from archival Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations are combined with stellar properties and spectral energy distributions to assemble a detailed picture of the inner disk.

The near-infrared excess is uncorrelated with the mm dust mass of the inner disk. The size-luminosity correlation known for protoplanetary disks is recovered for the inner disks as well, consistent with radial drift. The inner disks are depleted in dust relative to the outer disk and their dust mass is uncorrelated with the accretion rates. This is interpreted as the result of radial drift and trapping by planets in a low $\alpha$ ($\sim 10^{-3}$) disk, or a failure of the $\alpha$-disk model to describe angular momentum transport and accretion. The only disk in our sample with confirmed planets in the gap, PDS 70, has an inner disk with a significantly larger radius and lower inferred gas-to-dust ratio than other disks in the sample.

However, these algorithms require the user to manually define behavioral descriptors, which is used to determine whether two solutions are different or similar. The choice of a behavioral descriptor is crucial, as it completely changes the solution types that the algorithm derives. In this paper, we introduce a new method to automatically define this descriptor by combining Quality-Diversity algorithms with unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithms. This approach enables robots to autonomously discover the range of their capabilities while interacting with their environment. The results from two experimental scenarios demonstrate that robot can autonomously discover a large range of possible behaviors, without any prior knowledge about their morphology and environment.

In contrast, users on the decreasing engagement pathway show distinct behavior: they limit their CT discussions to specialized topics, participate in diverse discussion groups, and show reduced conformity with conspiracy subreddits.

Although case counts vary significantly between affected provinces in Mainland China, the scaling law $t^{\mu}$ is surprisingly universal, with a range of exponents $\mu=2.1\pm0.3$. The universality of this behavior indicates that despite social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities of affected Chinese provinces, this outbreak is dominated by fundamental mechanisms that are not captured by standard epidemiological models. We show that the observed scaling law is a direct consequence of containment policies that effectively deplete the susceptible population. To this end we introduce a parsimonious model that captures both, quarantine of symptomatic infected individuals as well as population wide isolation in response to mitigation policies or behavioral changes. For a wide range of parameters, the model reproduces the observed scaling law in confirmed cases and explains the observed exponents. Quantitative fits to empirical data permit the identification of peak times in the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic, unidentified infected individuals, as well as estimates of local variations in the basic reproduction number. The model implies that the observed scaling law in confirmed cases is a direct signature of effective contaiment strategies and/or systematic behavioral changes that affect a substantial fraction of the susceptible population.

Despite the continuous development in the field, we have still limited knowledge about how deformation - one of the representative nuclear structures - affects multinucleon transfer reactions. Purpose: To shed light on the effect of deformation in multinucleon transfer processes, we study the $^{16}$O+$^{154}$Sm reaction at $E_{\rm lab}$=85 MeV (around the Coulomb barrier) and 134 MeV (substantially above the Coulomb barrier), where the target nucleus, $^{154}$Sm, is a well-established, deformed nucleus. Results: Angular distributions for elastic scattering and for various transfer channels were measured over a wide angular range at the BARC-TIFR pelletron-Linac accelerator facility, Mumbai. The $Q$-value- and angle-integrated isotope production cross sections have been extracted from the measured angular distributions. The experimental data are analyzed along with time-dependent Hartree-Fock calculations. For the lower incident energy case, we find a reasonable agreement between the measurements and the TDHF calculations for a-few-nucleon transfer channels; whereas TDHF underestimates cross sections for many-nucleon transfers, consistent with earlier works. On the other side, we find that calculated cross sections for secondary reaction products for the higher incident energy case, qualitatively explains the measured trends of isotopic distributions observed for the lower energy. The latter observation indicates possible underestimation of excitation energies in the present TDHF+GEMINI analysis. Although certain orientation effects were observed in TDHF results, it is difficult to disentangle them from the $Q$-value- and angle-integrated production cross sections.

In nature, however, there will be inhomogenous distributions of rotational velocity and density along the outer radius ($R_o$) marking the sphere of influence of a black hole. While there have been many studies of how the Bondi solution changes with a prescribed angular momentum boundary condition, they have all assumed a constant density at $R_o$. In this Letter, we show that a non-uniform density at $R_o$ causes a meridional flow and due to conservation of angular momentum, the Bondi solution qualitatively changes into an inflow-outflow solution. Using physical arguments, we analytically identify the critical logarithmic density gradient $|\partial{\ln{\rho}}/\partial{\theta}|$ above which this change of the solution occurs. For realistic $R_o$, this critical gradient is less than 0.01 and tends to 0 as $R_o \rightarrow \infty$. We show using numerical simulations that, unlike for solutions with an imposed rotational velocity, the accretion rate for solutions under an inhomogenous density boundary condition remains constant at nearly the Bondi rate $\dot{M}_B$, while the outflow rate can greatly exceed $\dot{M}_B$.

The results across 188 antigens demonstrate the benefit of AntBO in designing CDRH3 regions with diverse biophysical properties.

Our sample range in $T_{\rm eff}$ from $\sim$ 3200 to 3800K, where eleven stars are in binary systems with a warmer (FGK) primary, while the other 10 M-dwarfs have interferometric radii in the literature. We define an $M_{K_{S}}$--Radius calibration based on our M-dwarf radii derived from the detailed analysis of APOGEE spectra and Gaia DR2 distances, as well as a mass-radius relation using the spectroscopically-derived surface gravities. A comparison of the derived radii with interferometric values from the literature finds that the spectroscopic radii are slightly offset towards smaller values, with $\Delta$ = -0.01 $\pm$ 0.02 $R{\star}$/$R_{\odot}$. In addition, the derived M-dwarf masses based upon the radii and surface gravities tend to be slightly smaller (by $\sim$5-10\%) than masses derived for M-dwarf members of eclipsing binary systems for a given stellar radius. The metallicities derived for the 11 M-dwarfs in binary systems, compared to metallicities obtained for their hotter FGK main-sequence primary stars from the literature, shows excellent agreement, with a mean difference of [Fe/H](M-dwarf - FGK primary) = +0.04 $\pm$ 0.18 dex, confirming the APOGEE metallicity scale derived here for M-dwarfs.

While neighborhood exploration procedures are well developed for problems with individual services, their counterparts for one-to-one pickup-and-delivery problems have been more scarcely studied. A direct extension of classic neighborhoods is often inefficient or complex due to the necessity of jointly considering service pairs. To circumvent these issues, we introduce major improvements to existing neighborhood searches for the pickup-and-delivery traveling salesman problem and new large neighborhoods. We show that the classical Relocate-Pair neighborhood can be fully explored in $O(n^2)$ instead of $O(n^3)$ time. We adapt the 4-Opt and Balas-Simonetti neighborhoods to consider precedence constraints. Moreover, we introduce an exponential-size neighborhood called 2k-Opt, which includes all solutions generated by multiple nested 2-Opts and can be searched in $O(n^2)$ time using dynamic programming. We conduct extensive computational experiments, highlighting the significant contribution of these new neighborhoods and speed-up strategies within two classical metaheuristics. Notably, our approach permits to repeatedly solve small pickup-and-delivery problem instances to optimality or near-optimality within milliseconds, and therefore it represents a valuable tool for time-critical applications such as meal delivery or mobility of demand.

We detected an extended stellar emission in the nucleus that, at first, appears to be, in the optical band, two stellar nuclei separated by a stream of dust. The active galactic nucleus (AGN) is identified as a variable point-like source between these two stellar components. There is a central hard X-ray emission and an extended soft X-ray emission that closely coincides with the ionization cone, as seen in the [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission. The centroid of the [O I]$\lambda$6300 emission does not coincide with the AGN, being shifted by 0.24 arcsec towards the ionization cone; this shift is probably caused by a combination of differential dust extinction together with emission and reflection in the ionization cone. The optical spectra extracted from the central region are typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. We also identify 10 H II regions, eight of them in a star forming ring that is visible in Br$\gamma$, [Fe II]$\lambda$16436 and molecular CO(3-2) images observed in previous studies. Such a ring also presents weak hard X-ray emission, probably associated with supernova remnants, not detected in other studies. The position of the AGN coincides with the centre of a nuclear spiral (detected in previous works) that brings gas and dust from the bar to the nucleus, causing the high extinction in this area.

Here we study the signature of co-orbital exoplanets in transit surveys when two planet candidates in the system orbit the star with similar periods. Such pair of candidates could be discarded as false positives because they are not Hill-stable. However, horseshoe or long libration period tadpole co-orbital configurations can explain such period similarity. This degeneracy can be solved by considering the Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of each planet. We then focus on the three planet candidates system TOI-178: the two outer candidates of that system have similar orbital period and had an angular separation near $\pi/3$ during the TESS observation of sector 2. Based on the announced orbits, the long-term stability of the system requires the two close-period planets to be co-orbitals. Our independent detrending and transit search recover and slightly favour the three orbits close to a 3:2:2 resonant chain found by the TESS pipeline, although we cannot exclude an alias that would put the system close to a 4:3:2 configuration. We then analyse in more detail the co-orbital scenario. We show that despite the influence of an inner planet just outside the 2:3 mean-motion resonance, this potential co-orbital system can be stable on the Giga-year time-scale for a variety of planetary masses, either on a trojan or a horseshoe orbit.

Each method, in different ways, provides exact and global analyses of nonlinear systems by way of linear systems theory. The main results of this paper show equivalence between contraction and Koopman approaches for a wide class of stability analysis and control design problems. In particular: stability or stablizability in the Koopman framework implies the existence of a contraction metric (resp. control contraction metric) for the nonlinear system. Further in certain cases the converse holds: contraction implies the existence of a set of observables with which stability can be verified via the Koopman framework. We provide results for the cases of autonomous and time-varying systems, as well as orbital stability of limit cycles. Furthermore, the converse claims are based on a novel relation between the Koopman method and construction of a Kazantzis-Kravaris-Luenberger observer. We also provide a byproduct of the main results, that is, a new method to learn contraction metrics from trajectory data via linear system identification.

We address these shortcomings by proposing the Context-encoding Variational Autoencoder (ceVAE) which combines reconstruction- with density-based anomaly scoring. This improves the sample- as well as pixel-wise results. In our experiments on the BraTS-2017 and ISLES-2015 segmentation benchmarks, the ceVAE achieves unsupervised ROC-AUCs of 0.95 and 0.89, respectively, thus outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin.

Analogously, this suggests that learned optimizers may similarly outperform current hand-designed optimizers, especially for specific problems. However, learned optimizers are notoriously difficult to train and have yet to demonstrate wall-clock speedups over hand-designed optimizers, and thus are rarely used in practice. Typically, learned optimizers are trained by truncated backpropagation through an unrolled optimization process resulting in gradients that are either strongly biased (for short truncations) or have exploding norm (for long truncations). In this work we propose a training scheme which overcomes both of these difficulties, by dynamically weighting two unbiased gradient estimators for a variational loss on optimizer performance, allowing us to train neural networks to perform optimization of a specific task faster than tuned first-order methods.

Pop III galaxies, however, are typically expected to be too faint and too few in number to be detectable by forthcoming instruments without extremely long integration times and/or extreme lensing. In an environment, however, where star formation is suppressed until a halo crosses the atomic cooling limit (e.g., by a modest Lyman-Werner flux, high baryonic streaming velocities, and/or dynamical heating effects),primordial halos can form substantially more numerous and more massive stars. Some of these stars will in-turn be accreting more rapidly than they can thermally relax at any given time. Using high resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of massive star formation in high-z halos, we find that such rapidly accreting stars produce prominent spectral features which would be detectable by {\it JWST}.

A relativistically expanding plasma shell can compress the ambient magnetic field, like a moving mirror, and thus produce coherent radiation whose wavelength is shorter than that of the ambient medium by $\gamma^2$. This mechanism has been studied in the past by Colgate and Noerdelinger (1971), in the context of radio loud supernova explosions. In this work we propose that a similar mechanism drives the coherent emission in fast radio bursts. The high Lorenz factors dramatically lower the implied energy and magnetic field requirements, allowing the spin down energy of regular (or even recycled), fast spinning pulsars, rather than slow spinning magnetars, to explain FRBs. We show that this model can explain the frequency and the time evolution of observed FRBs, as well as their duration, energetics and absence of panchromatic counterparts. We also predict that the peak frequency of sub pulses decline with observation time as $\omega_{\rm obs} \propto t_{\rm obs}^{-1/2}$. Unfortunately, with current capabilities it is not possible to constrain the shape of the curve $\omega_{\rm obs} \left(t_{\rm obs} \right)$. Finally, we find that a variation of this model can explain weaker radio transients, such as the one observed from a galactic magnetar. In this variant, the shock wave produces low frequency photons which are then Compton scattered to the GHz range.

We find the stellar masses of the galaxies formed in Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) with $\sigma/m= 1\, cm^2/g$ are very similar to those in CDM (spanning $M_{\star} \approx 10^{5.7 - 7.0} M_{\odot}$) and all runs lie on a similar stellar mass -- size relation. The logarithmic dark matter density slope ($\alpha=d\log \rho / d\log r$) in the central $250-500$ pc remains steeper than $\alpha= -0.8$ for the CDM-Hydro simulations with stellar mass $M_{\star} \sim 10^{6.6} M_{\odot}$ and core-like in the most massive galaxy. In contrast, every SIDM hydrodynamic simulation yields a flatter profile, with $\alpha >-0.4$. Moreover, the central density profiles predicted in SIDM runs without baryons are similar to the SIDM runs that include FIRE-2 baryonic physics. Thus, SIDM appears to be much more robust to the inclusion of (potentially uncertain) baryonic physics than CDM on this mass scale, suggesting SIDM will be easier to falsify than CDM using low-mass galaxies.

We construct a directed and weighted network in which vertices represent cities and edges connote pairwise economic dependence between cities. Cities (vertices) represent the collection of all firms in that location and links denote intercity wire transfers. We find a high degree of economic integration among cities in the trade network, which is consistent with the high degree of specialization found across Brazilian cities. We are able to identify which cities have a dominant role in the entire supply chain process using centrality network measures. We find that the trade network has a disassortative mixing pattern, which is consistent with the power-law shape of the firm size distribution in Brazil. After the Brazilian recession in 2014, we find that the disassortativity becomes even stronger as a result of the death of many small firms and the consequent concentration of economic flows on large firms. Our results suggest that recessions have a large impact on the trade network with meaningful and heterogeneous economic consequences across municipalities. We run econometric exercises and find that courts efficiency plays a dual role. From the customer perspective, it plays an important role in reducing contractual frictions as it increases economic transactions between different cities. From the supplier perspective, cities that are central suppliers to the supply chain seem to use courts inefficiency as a lawsuit barrier from their customers.

In the early phase, when the infall of matter from the surrounding envelope is substantial, the star accumulates mass primarily because of envelope-induced gravitational instability in a protostellar disc. In this phase, we model the envelope mass accretion rate from the isothermal free-fall collapse of a molecular cloud core. The disc gains mass from the envelope, and also transports matter to the star via a disc accretion mechanism that includes episodic gravitational instability and mass accretion bursts according to the Toomre $Q$-criterion. In the early phase the envelope accretion is dominant, whereas in the late phase the disc accretion is dominant. In the disc accretion phase, mass is accreted on to the star due to gravitational torques within the spiral structures in the disc, in a manner that analytic theory suggests has a mass accretion rate $\propto t^{-6/5}$. Our model provides a self-consistent evolution of the mass accretion rate by joining the spherical envelope accretion with the disc accretion and accounts for the presence of episodic accretion bursts at appropriate times. We show using a simple example that the burst mode is essential to explain the long-standing 'luminosity problem' of young stellar objects. The bursts are needed to provide a good match to the observed distribution of bolometric luminosities. In contrast, a smoothly time-dependent mass accretion rate, whether monotonically increasing or decreasing, is unable to do so. Our framework reproduces key elements of detailed numerical simulations of disc accretion and can aid in developing intuition about the basic physics as well as in comparing theory with observations.

Second, these methods lack adequate justification beyond simple, tabular, finite-state settings.

We systematically evaluate our approach and empirically show that it generalizes beyond the tabular, finite-state setting.

Instead of assuming independence between neighbouring tokens (semi-autoregressive decoding, SA), we take inspiration from bidirectional sequence generation and introduce a decoder that generates target words from the left-to-right and right-to-left directions simultaneously. We show that we can easily convert a standard architecture for unidirectional decoding into a bidirectional decoder by simply interleaving the two directions and adapting the word positions and self-attention masks. Our interleaved bidirectional decoder (IBDecoder) retains the model simplicity and training efficiency of the standard Transformer, and on five machine translation tasks and two document summarization tasks, achieves a decoding speedup of ~2X compared to autoregressive decoding with comparable quality. Notably, it outperforms left-to-right SA because the independence assumptions in IBDecoder are more felicitous. To achieve even higher speedups, we explore hybrid models where we either simultaneously predict multiple neighbouring tokens per direction, or perform multi-directional decoding by partitioning the target sequence. These methods achieve speedups to 4X-11X across different tasks at the cost of <1 BLEU or <0.5 ROUGE (on average).

We extracted about 200 000 light curves of stars in 645 open clusters located in the southern ecliptic hemisphere and observed by TESS during the first year of its mission. We searched for transiting signals and we found 33 objects of interest, 11 of them are strong candidate exoplanets. Because of the limited S/N, we did not find any Earth or super-Earth. We identified two Neptune-size planets orbiting stars with $R_{\star}<1.5\,R_{\odot}$, implying a frequency $f_{\star}=1.34 \pm 0.95\,\%$, consistent with the frequency around field stars. The 7 Jupiter candidates around stars with $R_{\star}<\,1.5R_{\odot}$ imply a frequency $f_{\star}=0.19\pm 0.07\,\%$, smaller than in the field.

We find that we can produce a self-consistent model in which a population of collapsars with stochastic europium yields synthesizes all of the r-process material in metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2.5) stars. Our model reproduces the observed scatter and evolution of scatter of [Eu/Fe] abundances. We find that if collapsars are the dominant r-process site for metal-poor stars, r-process synthesis may be linked to supernovae that produce long gamma-ray bursts. Our results also allow for the possibility that core-collapse supernovae beyond those that launch gamma-ray bursts also produce r-process material (e.g., potentially a subset of Type Ic-BL supernovae). Furthermore, we identify collapsar jet properties (isotropic energy, engine luminosity, or engine time) which may trace r-process yield and verify that the amount of r-process yield produced per collapsar in our model (~0.07 Msun) is consistent with other independent estimates. In the future, achieving 0.05 dex precision on distribution scatter or a reliable selection function would further constrain our probe of r-process production. Our model would also hold for another prompt r-process site with a power-law yield, and work is needed to determine if, for example, fast-merging neutron stars can also explain abundance scatter.

We obtained photometric and spectroscopic follow-up in the optical and near-infrared (NIR), covering both the prompt and afterglow emission from a few minutes up to 7.5 Ms after burst. With an isotropic gamma-ray energy of Eiso=1.27x10^54erg, GRB 210905A lies in the top ~7% GRBs in terms of energy released. Its afterglow is among the most luminous ever observed and, in particular, it is one of the most luminous in the optical at t<0.5 d, in the rest frame. The afterglow starts with a shallow evolution that can be explained by energy injection, and is followed by a steeper decay, while the spectral energy distribution is in agreement with slow cooling in a constant-density environment within the standard fireball theory. A jet break at 39+-21 d has been observed in the X-ray light curve; however, it is hidden in the H-band, potentially due to a constant contribution from an unknown component, most likely a foreground intervening galaxy and/or the host galaxy. We derived a half-opening angle of 7.9+-1.6 degrees, the highest ever measured for a z>~6 burst but within the range covered by closer events. The resulting collimation-corrected gamma-ray energy of 10^52erg is also among the highest ever measured. The moderately large half-opening angle argues against recent claims of an inverse dependence of the half-opening angle on the redshift. The total jet energy is likely too large for a standard magnetar, and suggests that the central engine of this burst was a newly formed black hole. Despite the outstanding energetics and luminosity of both GRB 210905A and its afterglow, we demonstrate that they are consistent within 2swith those of less distant bursts, indicating that the powering mechanisms and progenitors do not evolve significantly with redshift.

Particularly, we have tested a proactive network analysis system in which the workload demands are highly variable. In the context of the dReDBox disaggregated architecture, the results show that the overhead caused by using remote memory resources is significant, between 66\% and 80\%, but we have also observed that the memory usage is one order of magnitude higher for the stress case with respect to average workloads. Therefore, dimensioning memory for the worst case in conventional systems will result in a notable waste of resources. Finally, we found that, for the selected use case, parallelism is limited by memory. Therefore, using a disaggregated architecture will allow for increased parallelism, which, at the same time, will mitigate the overhead caused by remote memory.

In this work, we show that extending the smoothing technique to defend against other attack models can be challenging, especially in the high-dimensional regime. In particular, for a vast class of i.i.d.~smoothing distributions, we prove that the largest $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified decreases as $O(1/d^{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{p}})$ with dimension $d$ for $p > 2$. Notably, for $p \geq 2$, this dependence on $d$ is no better than that of the $\ell_p$-radius that can be certified using isotropic Gaussian smoothing, essentially putting a matching lower bound on the robustness radius. When restricted to {\it generalized} Gaussian smoothing, these two bounds can be shown to be within a constant factor of each other in an asymptotic sense, establishing that Gaussian smoothing provides the best possible results, up to a constant factor, when $p \geq 2$. We present experimental results on CIFAR to validate our theory.

In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that only certain mass accretion rates result in detectable bandhead emission in the near infrared spectra of MYSOs. Using an analytic disc model combined with an LTE model of the CO emission, we find that high accretion rates ($\gtrsim 10^{-4}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in large dust sublimation radii, a larger contribution to the $K$-band continuum from hot dust at the dust sublimation radius, and therefore correspondingly lower CO emission with respect to the continuum. On the other hand, low accretion rates ($\lesssim10^{-6}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}{\mathrm{yr}}^{-1}$) result in smaller dust sublimation radii, a correspondingly smaller emitting area of CO, and thus also lower CO emission with respect to the continuum. In general, moderate accretion rates produce the most prominent, and therefore detectable, CO first overtone emission. We compare our findings to a recent near-infrared spectroscopic survey of MYSOs, finding results consistent with our hypothesis. We conclude that the detection rate of CO bandhead emission in the spectra of MYSOs could be the result of MYSOs exhibiting a range of mass accretion rates, perhaps due to the variable accretion suggested by recent multi-epoch observations of these objects.

We demonstrate with a proof that this claim does not hold for integer discrete flows due to the embedding of data with finite support into the countably infinite integer lattice. Furthermore, we zoom in on the effect of gradient bias due to the straight-through estimator in integer discrete flows, and demonstrate that its influence is highly dependent on architecture choices and less prominent than previously thought. Finally, we show how different architecture modifications improve the performance of this model class for lossless compression, and that they also enable more efficient compression: a model with half the number of flow layers performs on par with or better than the original integer discrete flow model.

We identify companion candidates from a sample of K-type, pre-main sequence stars in the Scorpius Centaurus association using the early version of the third data release of the Gaia space mission. Based on the provided positions, proper motions, and magnitudes, we identify all objects within a predefined radius whose differential proper motions are consistent with a gravitationally bound system. We derive companion masses through comparison with evolutionary tracks. For seven identified companion candidates we use additional data collected with VLT/SPHERE and VLT/NACO to assess the accuracy of the properties of the companions based on Gaia photometry alone. We identify 110 comoving companions that have a companionship likelihood of more than $95\,\%$. We identify ten especially intriguing companions that have masses in the brown dwarf regime down to $20\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. Our high-contrast imaging data confirm both astrometry and photometric masses derived from Gaia alone. We discover a new brown dwarf companion, TYC 8252-533-1 B, with a projected separation of approximately $570\,\mathrm{au}$ from its Sun-like primary. SED modeling provides a companion mass of $52^{+17}_{-11}\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$. We show that the Gaia database can identify low-mass companions at wide separations from their host stars. For K-type Sco-Cen members Gaia can detect sub-stellar objects at projected separations larger than $300\,\mathrm{au}$ and is sensitivity limited beyond $1,000\,\mathrm{au}$ with a lower mass limit down to $20\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$.

Our interest is in misreporting behavior, and how respondents' tendency to under- or overreport a binary outcome might affect the power of the experiment. We model the problem by assuming each individual in our study is a member of one ""reporting class"": a truth-teller, underreporter, overreporter, or false-teller. We show that the joint distribution of reporting classes and ""response classes"" (characterizing individuals' response to the treatment) will exactly define the bias and variance of the causal estimate in our experiment. Then, we propose a novel procedure for deriving sample sizes under the worst-case power corresponding to a given level of misreporting.

The metallicity and elemental abundance measurements of these stars offer us an opportunity to understand the formation and evolution of the nuclear star cluster. In addition, their proximity to the supermassive black hole ($\sim 0.5$ pc) offers a unique probe of the star formation and chemical enrichment in this extreme environment. We observed two stars identified by medium spectral-resolution observations as potentially having very high metallicities. We use spectral-template fitting with the PHOENIX grid and Bayesian inference to simultaneously constrain the overall metallicity, [M/H], alpha-element abundance [$\alpha$/Fe], effective temperature, and surface gravity of these stars. We find that one of the stars has very high metallicity ([M/H] $> 0.6$) and the other is slightly above solar metallicity. Both Galactic center stars have lines from scandium (Sc), vanadium (V), and yttrium (Y) that are much stronger than allowed by the PHOENIX grid. We find, using the spectral synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy, that [Sc/Fe] may be an order of magnitude above solar. For comparison, we also observed an empirical calibrator in NGC6791, the highest metallicity cluster known ([M/H] $\sim 0.4$). Most lines are well matched between the calibrator and the Galactic center stars, except for Sc, V, and Y, which confirms that their abundances must be anomalously high in these stars. These unusual abundances, which may be a unique signature of nuclear star clusters, offer an opportunity to test models of chemical enrichment in this region.
