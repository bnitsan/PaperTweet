0,0,"Ultra-diffuse galaxies that contain a large sample of globular clusters (GCs) offer an opportunity to test the predictions of galactic dynamics theory. NGC5846-UDG1 is an excellent example, with a high-quality sample of dozens of GC candidates. We show that the observed distribution of GCs in NGC5846-UDG1 is suggestive of mass segregation induced by gravitational dynamical friction. We present simple analytic calculations, backed by a series of numerical simulations, that naturally explain the observed present-day pattern of GC masses and radial positions. Subject to some assumptions on the GC population at birth, the analysis supports the possibility that NGC5846-UDG1 resides in a massive dark matter halo. This is an example for the use of GC-rich systems as dynamical (in addition to kinematical) tracers of dark matter. ",<>,paper on the arXiv today!

1,1,"We look for and place observational constraints on the imprint of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) soliton cores in rotation-dominated galaxies. Extending previous analyses, we find a conservative constraint which disfavors the soliton-host halo relation found in some numerical simulations over a broad range in the ULDM particle mass $m$. Combining the observational constraints with theoretical arguments for the efficiency of soliton formation via gravitational dynamical relaxation, and assuming that the soliton-halo relation is correct, our results disfavor ULDM from comprising 100\% of the total cosmological dark matter in the range $10^{-24}~{\rm eV}\lesssim m\lesssim10^{-20}~{\rm eV}$. The constraints probe the ULDM fraction down to $f\lesssim0.3$ of the total dark matter. ",<>,paper on the arXiv today!

2,2,"We investigate what the orbits of globular clusters (GCs) in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy can teach us about dark matter (DM). This problem was recently studied for ultralight dark matter (ULDM). We consider two additional models: (i) fermionic degenerate dark matter (DDM), where Pauli blocking should be taken into account in the dynamical friction computation; and (ii) self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). We give a simple and direct Fokker-Planck derivation of dynamical friction, new in the case of DDM and reproducing previous results in the literature for ULDM and cold DM. ULDM, DDM and SIDM were considered in the past as leading to cores in dSphs, a feature that acts to suppress dynamical friction and prolong GC orbits. For DDM we derive a version of the cosmological free streaming limit that is independent of the DM production mechanism, finding that DDM cannot produce an appreciable core in Fornax without violating Ly-$\alpha$ limits. If the Ly-$\alpha$ limit is discounted for some reason, then stellar kinematics data does allow a DDM core which could prolong GC orbits. For SIDM we find that significant prolongation of GC orbits could be obtained for values of the self-interaction cross section considered in previous works. In addition to reassessing the inspiral time using updated observational data, we give a new perspective on the so-called GC timing problem, demonstrating that for a cuspy cold DM profile dynamical friction predicts a $z=0$ radial distribution for the innermost GCs that is independent of initial conditions. The observed orbits of Fornax GCs are consistent with this expectation with a mild apparent fine-tuning at the level of $\sim25\%$. ",<>,"paper on the arXiv today!

3,3,"We present a critical assessment of the SN1987A supernova cooling bound on axions and other light particles. Core-collapse simulations used in the literature to substantiate the bound omitted from the calculation the envelope exterior to the proto-neutron star (PNS). As a result, the only source of neutrinos in these simulations was, by construction, a cooling PNS. We show that if the canonical delayed neutrino mechanism failed to explode SN1987A, and if the pre-collapse star was rotating, then an accretion disk would form that could explain the late-time ($t\gtrsim5$ sec) neutrino events. Such accretion disk would be a natural feature if SN1987A was a collapse-induced thermonuclear explosion. Axions do not cool the disk and do not affect its neutrino output, provided the disk is optically-thin to neutrinos, as it naturally is. These considerations cast doubt on the supernova cooling bound. ",<>,"paper on the arXiv today!

4,4,"Measurements of the dynamical environment of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are becoming abundant and precise. We use such measurements to look for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), which is predicted to form dense cores (""solitons"") in the centre of galactic halos. We search for the gravitational imprint of an ULDM soliton on stellar orbits near Sgr A* and by combining stellar velocity measurements with Event Horizon Telescope imaging of M87*. Finding no positive evidence, we set limits on the soliton mass for different values of the ULDM particle mass $m$. The constraints we derive exclude the solitons predicted by a naive extrapolation of the soliton-halo relation, found in DM-only numerical simulations, for $2\times10^{-20}~{\rm eV}\lesssim m\lesssim8\times10^{-19}~{\rm eV}$ (from Sgr A*) and $m\lesssim4\times10^{-22}~{\rm eV}$ (from M87*). However, we present theoretical arguments suggesting that an extrapolation of the soliton-halo relation may not be adequate: in some regions of the parameter space, the dynamical effect of the SMBH could cause this extrapolation to over-predict the soliton mass by orders of magnitude.

5,5,"Analytic arguments and numerical simulations show that bosonic ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) would form cored density distributions (`solitons') at the center of galaxies. ULDM solitons offer a promising way to exclude or detect ULDM by looking for a distinctive feature in the central region of galactic rotation curves. Baryonic contributions to the gravitational potential pose an obstacle to such analyses, being (i) dynamically important in the inner galaxy and (ii) highly non-spherical in rotation-supported galaxies, resulting in non-spherical solitons. We present an algorithm for finding the ground state soliton solution in the presence of stationary non-spherical background baryonic mass distribution. We quantify the impact of baryons on the predicted ULDM soliton in the Milky Way and in low surface-brightness galaxies from the SPARC database. ",<>,paper on the arXiv today!

6,6,"We study the ratio of neutrino-proton elastic scattering to inverse beta decay event counts, measurable in a scintillation detector like JUNO, as a key observable for identifying the explosion mechanism of a galactic core-collapse supernova. If the supernova is not powered by the core but rather, e.g., by collapse-induced thermonuclear explosion, then a prolonged period of accretion-dominated neutrino luminosity is predicted. Using 1D numerical simulations, we show that the distinct resulting flavour composition of the neutrino burst can be tested in JUNO with high significance, overcoming theoretical uncertainties in the progenitor star profile and equation of state.

7,7,"Bosonic ultra-light dark matter (ULDM) would form cored density distributions at the center of galaxies. These cores, seen in numerical simulations, admit analytic description as the lowest energy bound state solution (""soliton"") of the Schroedinger-Poisson equations. Numerical simulations of ULDM galactic halos found empirical scaling relations between the mass of the large-scale host halo and the mass of the central soliton. We discuss how the simulation results of different groups can be understood in terms of the basic properties of the soliton. Importantly, simulations imply that the energy per unit mass in the soliton and in the virialised host halo should be approximately equal. This relation lends itself to observational tests, because it predicts that the peak circular velocity, measured for the host halo in the outskirts of the galaxy, should approximately repeat itself in the central region. Contrasting this prediction to the measured rotation curves of well-resolved near-by galaxies, we show that ULDM in the mass range $m\sim (10^{-22}\div 10^{-21})$ eV, which has been invoked as a possible solution to the small-scale puzzles of $\Lambda$CDM, is in tension with the data. We suggest that a dedicated analysis of the Milky Way inner gravitational potential could probe ULDM up to $m\lesssim 10^{-19}$ eV. ",<>,paper on the arXiv!

8,8,"Turbulent thermal diffusion is a combined effect of the temperature stratified turbulence and inertia of small particles. It causes the appearance of a non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles in the direction of the turbulent heat flux. This non-diffusive turbulent flux of particles is proportional to the product of the mean particle number density and the effective velocity of inertial particles. The theory of this effect has been previously developed only for small temperature gradients and small Stokes numbers (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76}, 224, 1996). In this study a generalized theory of turbulent thermal diffusion for arbitrary temperature gradients and Stokes numbers has been developed. The laboratory experiments in the oscillating grid turbulence and in the multi-fan produced turbulence have been performed to validate the theory of turbulent thermal diffusion in strongly stratified turbulent flows. It has been shown that the ratio of the effective velocity of inertial particles to the characteristic vertical turbulent velocity for large Reynolds numbers is less than 1. The effective velocity of inertial particles as well as the effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion increase with Stokes numbers reaching the maximum at small Stokes numbers and decreases for larger Stokes numbers. The effective coefficient of turbulent thermal diffusion also decreases with the mean temperature gradient. It has been demonstrated that the developed theory is in a good agreement with the results of the laboratory experiments.
